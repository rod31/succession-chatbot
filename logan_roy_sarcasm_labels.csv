Where am I? Where the fuck am I?,
Ugh. Okay. Okay.,
Where am I?,
Uh-huh.,
By who?,
"I’m excited. Marcy! I thought this whole place was going to be ready? Have they fucked us on the internet because—? My emails— I’m going to call, Ellison or Gates because my emails are— Pencil! Where’s a—? (fucking pencil in this whole new set-up, it’s ridiculous!)",
"I’m not getting anything. Who do they think I am? Uncle Fuck. It’s not working, I’m not paying until—",
Uh-huh. Okay. He’s started floating. That wasn’t the arrangement. He’s offering one- twenty. He’s got a hard-on. You don’t walk around with a hard-on. Makes you look ridiculous. Get it trapped in the eye of the fucking Halloween pumpkin.,
"I’m on it, Marcia, don’t worry.",
I do.,
"Oh, yeah? Great. Turtles, all kinds of disgusting shit. Terrific.",
Just have Jan log them— so I can see which fuckers have dropped me already. Marcia—,
Look I’m not about to spill my guts like some queer. But you know. (I love you.),
"Marcy, I’m heading out, as ordered.",
Fine – but just here – yeah? I don’t want to get a fucking heart attack from the surprise. Have them here. And not too loud. Just – a—,
How’s it going?,
Oh yeah. Yeah. I just have some paperwork—,
For putting Marcy on the trust. Just bullshit. But I felt like checking in.,
Let’s see how this goes and I can lay it out.,
Nuh. I think I told you about—,
It’s housekeeping.,
I’ll deal with that. Okay. So – I’ll see you in—?,
"If you need to stay, you need to stay.",
I appreciate it.,
Oh. Right. I didn’t know you were coming?,
Uh-huh. Are you (alone)—?,
Thank you. You okay?,
Ah?,
Uh-huh.,
Sure. Good to see you.,
Uh?,
"Great. Excellent. Wonderful. Okay, give me some room? Connor, Primo! How are you?",
"Roman, Romulus! Look at you, you look fantastic!",
Siobhan. Sweetheart. Is Tom here?,
"Oh well, never mind. This is Craig, everyone, by the way. Cousin Craig.",
Kendall? You came.,
"So, what’s the news?",
You want the rival bid to go away? Banks are whores. Pay them and they’ll fuck anything. So cut them in on our financing and—,
Yeah the rules are for the – the people who like rules—,
Oh. Thank you. This is? These are nice. These are nice houses – where is that?,
I like Vancouver.,
Wow. The paper is very thick.,
"Oh sure. Great. This is— a quality item. I want to look at this properly later.† So, go on, give me five. What’s the news. What’s happening?",
Connor. How you going? How’s the ranch?,
Wonderful. What the hell is it?,
Uh-huh? Right?,
I do. I just don’t know what the fuck it is.,
"Oh, okay. Old bread. Thank you. How are we looking?",
Uh-huh. You did?,
You go on. I’m not going.,
"Hey, okay, listen, just two minutes before lunch? Kids. Can I get you, for two minutes?",
Not now.,
You’re out?,
I’ll do anything for my brother.,
He just needs to ask.,
Anything. Just get him to ask me.,
"Er – yeah. So. . On the family trust, that will decide the situation in the event of my unlikely demise. I’m going to add Marcia to myself and you four.",
With my seat also to go to her on my death—,
Uh-huh. So I’ve got the paperwork for—,
Kendall’s already signed up but if I can get you all to—,
Of course.,
"Sure. Take a beat. But look, I love the bread – goo and the picture book, but this is the present I really want? So by four, good? And also, I just mentioned this to Kendall, but despite the chatter, and all things considered I’m going to give it a couple of years.",
"I’ll stay in situ. As Chairman, CEO and head of the firm.",
"Well I just said, son, or were you not listening as usual?",
No big deal. I’m just staying on. We can discuss the details.,
We can announce you’re in pole position. Pending events. A move up or some—,
"Okay, lunch! C’mon.",
"I changed my mind, Kendall—",
I had doubts and then certain things caused me to rethink.,
It’s me. It’s mainly me. But you – you’re still— Three years ago you were still in the nuthouse.,
"It’s all good. I’m just worried – you might be soft, as yet.",
I hear the guy from the website trash-talked you and you let him just come?,
I hear it played weak. Conflict-averse.,
I hear you bent for him.,
I hear you bent for him and he fucked you?,
"Thing is, you’ve probably read a lot of books about management technique and this and that but you know what?",
Sometimes it is a big-dick competition.,
And you never lawyered the trust change.,
It’s an – an accumulation. You left the room. The deal.,
I don’t know – five?,
Ten?,
It’s my fucking company.,
That’s why you’re paying a billion dollars for a gay little website?,
"Do you want to hit me, is that it?",
Are you going to cry?,
Fuck them.,
"Okay. Thank you very much. Now, when we’re done. It’s time for the game.",
S’fine.,
Uh-huh.,
Did he?,
Uh-huh.,
Running parks?,
… I don’t like Lefty.,
Lefty.,
I don’t want him flying me.,
"He’s safe, I’m sure. But we had that bumpy touchdown on the Vineyard? He looks like a prick.",
He’s fine. Just—,
I don’t— Greg or Connor and—? It’s fine. You decide. did,
"So what you thinking, son? . On the thing? She’s really smart. She’d make good picks. Family first.",
So?,
"But, where’s your cut?",
I would love to get you back in?,
Frank is important to the firm.,
Is this still the film thing?,
So what would be your dream outfit?,
Uh-huh.,
How you feeling. We good?,
"He would? Okay … And for you. If things are getting shaken up, would you come inside?",
"No sure. Politics. Politics. Shiv, not to be crude, sweetheart, but politics is what comes out the asshole. Wouldn’t you like to be up front, feeding the horse?",
And if that was difficult? Overseeing everything outside the US – parks and all?,
Yeah? Stepping stones.,
Oh he screwed up. Needs help.,
I like him.,
Kind of. He’s scratchy. Hungry. I think he might fit at the parks eventually? Could Tom handle competition?,
Thanks.,
"That’s everything I look at, Tom.",
Of course. Everything okay?,
Okay. We okay?  –,
Yeah. Frank. I’ve been thinking if now isn’t a time for a new role for you?,
Light duties.,
"No one has as much respect as me for you, Frank—",
"It’s a step up. The press release should be on your phone. Just proof it. You might want to add some color, it’s quite dry.",
"So. What you say, kids?",
Frank’s out of the picture.,
"Frank’s dead. Tom should be stepping up. Shiv’s thinking about a new role. So, are we good?",
You what?,
Are you fucking joking?,
Then help.,
Where’s Frisk …?§,
Uh-huh? I love you.,
Huh. Getting better.,
Yafuginidit.,
Don’t patronize me. Walking’s not good. It’s fucking normal.,
I need a sit-down! Chair!,
"I don’t like ‘intimate body part’. Uh-huh. Your call, Eva. She tried to regulate every fucking sector in New York as AG, turns out she can’t regulate her own husband. If we don’t call out this frigid little – phony who will?",
Do I need permission?,
Chair?,
Just making sure you weren’t selling any more of the company from under me.,
"You’re lining up acquisitions, is that right?",
"Cuh. Nothing new under the sun. I was informed, you’re doing my ball speech, is that correct?",
"Yeah I was told the mailman’s prick tasted of toffee apple, but I didn’t believe him.",
Good luck to you. The Sad Sack Wasp Trap. One time a year anyone fucking likes us. Knock yourself out.,
Uh-huh.,
"So, you’ve done this for a few old— vegetables?",
Did you do Ollie Sirrett? After his?,
Uh-huh. And how many of us go back to normal?,
"Bullshit. Here’s a question. One to keep— (—) lock. Can they test me? Can they, get a doctor in to see if I’m—",
A sad case. Have you heard of that?,
"Morning? Personal first, then – the corporal.",
Say!,
Where did they get that? Who gave them that?,
Winding down. Winding fucking down? I’m winding up!,
Uh-huh?,
Uh-huh.,
Your mom loved all that. Fucking Wasp Trap.,
To?,
I’ve jerked him around enough.,
Uh-huh?,
Uh-huh?,
So you’re the little guy who owns such a big chunk of me?,
"Excuse me barging in. Just, Gerri told me you have a meet with Opalite Data later? Just to say, I like it, buy it. Okay, Ken?",
Sure. But if I don’t see you. I want it.,
I want us into data mining. Buy it.,
Yeah. And who wants gold? Make them an offer they get excited about. Make them an offer they tell their wives about that night.,
Matched with an aged wife.,
Fine. I just … need a piss.,
"Okay, Ken. Why don’t you grab the Opalite Data material and we can take a view?",
"Yeah well, you’re the business genius who sold me out to this fucker, so I’d love Stewart’s thoughts.",
"So I think we’re buying. Good with you, Stewart?",
"All good? And, Stewy, you going to the Sad Sack Wasp Trap tonight?",
I don’t know if I can do this.,
"So how many presidents you had in this contraption, buddy?",
Who’d you like?,
Ugh?,
What?,
No.,
"Thanks, son.",
He’s – Vice Chairman and your general advisor.,
Why? What’s the situation with the park numbers?,
Attendance is good but occupied-room nights are down on last year. Why?,
You need to soak up Frank’s experience.,
It means do what he fucking tells you.,
I’m good.,
So I’m sorry to hear your friend was getting crucified all day?,
"Evening. Gonna keep this brief. Thank you for coming. Thank you, to those that supported me through my recent, health – nonsense. Head cold. So – yes. Congratulations to all the grantees, amazing, work. Huge fan of contemporary dance. In personal news. Someone took advantage of my being in the hospital. To propose to my daughter. So I’d like to take this opportunity to welcome her fiancé, Tom Wambsgans, to the family. Welcome to the family, Tom. It’s so important that children are encouraged and supported. Everything I’ve done in my life has been for my children. And I’m proud of the way they’ve pulled together during my recent … issue. Kendall in particular. Well done, Ken. And tonight I have one last announcement …",
"I’m officially announcing … I’m back. You better believe, I’m back! Full time. Better than ever!",
Get me out of here!,
"Went well, I thought.",
"I see you. I spied you fucking out, son. Don’t try that again.",
Retire me? Shoot me like a dog in the street. I heard about your little speech?,
Bullshit.,
Huh.,
You did well tonight … Connor. I’m proud of you.,
Uh-huh?,
"Oh, look out, folks, here come the ‘top minds’!",
"Really no need, gentlemen, Frank wanted to fold you in. But you should know probably my thinking in terms of – things.",
"‘I don’t know, Kendall, you tell me.’",
"You know there’s this fancy new business theory, son? It’s called, ‘make more than you spend and you’re King Cunt’.",
I like putting the knife in the rival canoes. We’re the number-five media conglomerate in the world …,
Time to be number one.,
And I want to look at a broadcast network. And I want to see what other news operations we can sweep up.,
Why shouldn’t we do all the news?,
Fuck off. People come to us because we don’t try to sell them on anything. No packet of fucking bleeding-heart United Nations Volvo gender-bender horseshit.,
"Nah. TV’s getting fucked, it’s gotta consolidate.",
Of course. India. China. You know how many fucking people there are in Indonesia?,
"Roman, you’re a moron. I think you should get into all that for us, Kendall.",
"Get back into that, over there. Vice-President Global and Digital. Out of Dubai, wherever. China, India.",
Meeting’s over.,
Great.,
Ewan? Bullshit. Why?,
You’re a pretty good liar.,
It’s not a rift. He just lives in Canada. And is a prick.,
We send him a fucking birthday card don’t we? Not that I get any thanks. Think I need some physical therapy.,
"Well, Ewan.",
How was the journey then?,
"Thank you, I’ve been extremely unwell.",
So. How’s the ranch?,
"Any  issues. Huh? When we were kids, my uncle used to get us to kill the squirrels. I’d throw them in the trash but Ewan used to bury them with Palm Sunday crosses for headstones.",
"One time, Ewan had been watching them tanning hides at a ranch. Tell them what you did.",
Used it as a blanket for his teddy bear.,
Took him about a week all in all. But you tanned that tiny hide.,
Don’t go out there. Get him in here! He needs to be told.,
Maybe some other time?,
Varies. This is a Victoria Cross.,
This is a World War I 16th Canadian Infantry medal.,
"Now, of course the Assyrians wore medals before the Romans but this is Roman and—",
Maybe don’t touch. This one did cost rather a lot.,
I collect them out of respect.,
"Look, fifty years ago you volunteered for a war because you wanted to impress the town slut and no one’s ever allowed to hear the end of it.",
"Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you, what do you want, a medal?",
Viet Cong coming up your drainpipe in Ottawa were they?,
Did you even fire a gun? Didn’t you end up cleaning grill for the catering corps?,
"‘Bear any burden, stir any gumbo.’",
"Bullshit, you don’t have them because you’re bitter.",
"Yeah yeah, you got your fucking nut, Captain Cautious.",
Uh-huh. Ever heard of a begging letter?,
"Oh yeah, big man, big brother, wouldn’t eat a blueberry till they’d been weighed and written in the ledger? Little Miss Prim.",
Yeah yeah. Heard it all before.,
For what?,
"Are you trying to leave dramatically, Ewan?",
Go to other people’s dinners?,
You’re not getting (married)—?,
I went to market and I bought. Local TV.,
What … ?,
Um …,
Big … turkey?,
"Are you alright? I hardly touched him, it’s the shock. Relax. Relax, boy!",
"Get him a mirror, get him a mirror!",
"I went to the market and bought a potato, a new hat, a pony, a big fat hen and this.",
Nothing. Fucking Wi-Fi on this phone. How much do we pay the crooks for this crap? Okay. No it’s okay I was on the wrong fucking thing—,
It’s not my blood sugar. I’m pissed I have to come to him like a fucking FedEx guy. Why can’t he come to us?,
"Fucking Californian shrunken little raisin. Seen ten of them. He’s basically an intern. And you’re okay on this, Karl? On the law?",
Wish she was here not you.,
"It’s a joke, Karl.",
"It’s gone. It’s fucking gone! Call Microsoft, call Gates, we should run one of these outfits, this is all fucking bullshit!",
Why? Do you wanna fucking make out with me? Course I’m okay. I just want this nailed down.,
"D’you think, Karl? He waves this through, he gets hundreds of local TV stations most amenable to talking about what a fucking great guy he is.",
Uh-huh. I’ve been here before. AIDE 1 Someone will be with you shortly.,
"The whole fucking song and dance. AIDE 2 Mr Roy, I am so sorry. But the president passes on his sincere apologies, he’s currently dealing with a matter of Homeland Security. He’s sure you’ll understand, but he’s going to need to offer an alternative face for this discussion.",
Have I been snubbed? Find out if I’ve been snubbed.,
Is this a snubbing? Just fucking find out.,
"Maybe. Or maybe it’s the new ‘can I get out of gym class, I’m on my Homeland Security Period?’ bullshit.",
You’re not the boss of me.,
She’s got her own game going on.,
You know what it means. You’ve got your game going on. I’ve got my game.,
Everyone’s got a game.,
"So. What’s going on, what’s the action? What’s the story?",
You heard about my meet? You heard if it was a snub?,
"I’m not discussing that. Thank you for coming though. And, so, you know, the thing with Iverson. That was an accident. You try to be a good dad.",
"Morning, Colin. Good day for the race.",
"Morning, morning. Good turn-out. So, Frank? Will you whip us through?",
"No, he can catch up. Fuck that – where is he?",
"Come on, let’s go.",
Ewan? Can’t keep you away.,
"What’s ‘Performance Issues’, Frank? This looks fucking vague, why’s it so high in the hit parade?",
What the fuck is going on?,
What is this? What the fuck is this?,
"Fuck that. We’re moving on, what is this?",
What the fuck?,
Speak up. Can’t hear!,
Bullshit. No.,
"Jesus Christ, it’s amateur hour at the fucking circus.",
Fine. Vote!,
"I’m sick. I can’t move, fuck that. Vote! Come on.",
Let the minutes show Logan Roy shoved a boot up Frank’s ass.,
Thanks for nothing. Fuck off.,
"Go ahead! What we on? Four against two, go on, fuck it, join the rats. Let’s finish this.",
"Datu, we’re voting now.",
"Hey, Kendall – you counted, right? You alright there? Four against four? This your best shot?",
"He’s off the line. C’mon, son!",
"You better be smelling your fucking armpit, Romulus.",
Roman for me.,
Roman?,
"He  fucking change. Whatever. Count him, out. Deadlock! Continuity prevails. I’m Chairman, casting vote, I win, it’s fucking over! My son! You lost.",
"And Kendall – Frank – Asha, Ilona. Off the board. Fired, with immediate effect!",
Fuck you. I can do anything. By-law. Lucy! Jeane! Security.,
Security!,
"I’m in the middle of turning the fucking tanker! Frank, you are fired, without exit package. Asha, goodbye. Someone send a telegram to Ilona and tell her she’s no longer required and my best to her cancer.",
Meh meh meh meh meh fucking meh.,
"Take it like a fucking man. You’re out. You’re fucked. You tried to kill me but you failed and you’re dead, okay? Now fuck off.",
"Cry me a river. Go on. Out! Straight out, passes canceled, we’ll send the personal belongings along. No goodbyes, thank you. What am I going to do with you?",
My children have betrayed me.,
I’ve got no one to trust. Only Marcia.,
You work for that bitch. No one gives me an ounce of credit. You all stir up this poison together.,
Tell them I’m on. Then put him on hold for a little while? (Classic Labor Songs),
Fine. Don’t get all over me.,
"I’m here, okay? I understand you want me to take you through my every thought?",
It’s so great to have the wisdom of my son’s college drinking buddy in the room.,
"Local TV, it’s just the beginning. A very scalable sector. Regulation’s in tatters, and as people shit their pants over online, I can buy everything up and still play the little guy.",
"It’s cloudy, it’s sunny.",
Maybe we’ll buy that too.,
"When did we start having to do this shit, Gerri? If I wanted good PR I’d stand on a red carpet in a fucking see-through dress.",
And she gets it?,
Whatever. Just as long as I don’t have to read it. And this shit. Who is this guy? Alon? Is he going to bust my chops?,
‘Corporate therapist’. What does he do? Ask Microsoft how it’s feeling? Fucking ridiculous.,
How long do I have to sit there?,
Can we just  I did it?,
In case there’s a God?,
Do they all have to be there? Does the traitor come too? Can we Photoshop the prick in?,
Uh-huh.,
No?,
Okay. Well. Plan B. Operation Black Sheep.,
Uh-huh.,
Thank you. Thank you. It exists!,
"So, son, we need somewhere for them to set up? Just a few folk to help us with photos and such, chroniclers of everything.",
"You’re doing great, son.",
"Nothing fancy, words and pictures. Family shots. Whilst we’re all alive. Good?",
Uh-huh. I don’t need any.,
"Family. Now then. We are all gathered here in this beautiful home— Because there are things to address and I believe we should … address them. I think I mentioned all around that we will also have a small celebration of our being together with some photographs tomorrow, nothing fancy. As you age you begin to appreciate, capturing memories and pinning them … down. So. Allow me now to introduce Alon Parfit.",
Right. This has been fantastic. But I’m going to bed!,
Therapy! Therapy! This way for the therapy! This is fantastic!,
C’mon is no one gonna have a pop at the champ?,
I can start if you want?,
Everything I’ve done in my life is for my children. And I know I’ve made mistakes but I have always tried to do my best by them because they are everything to me. And I love them.,
Thank you.,
How do you mean?,
Look. Everything I’ve done is for my children. And I know I’ve made mistakes but …,
"That’s what I feel, Siobhan, I can make shit up if you want?",
No. No absolutely not. I wouldn’t bring you out here for a photo and an interview.,
I told you a photo and an interview.,
It’s optional! It won’t be questions. Apparently it’s ‘rural wear’. I don’t know.,
Fine. I don’t believe it is all.,
I am trying to buy a number of television stations.,
Fine. Tell me what more you want here and I’ll dance the dance.,
I’m feeling I need to check my emails.,
I’m doing therapy!,
I am.,
You don’t have to worry about that.,
That’s not something we’re dealing with today. It’s beyond the remit.,
I had nothing to do with those stories.,
"You think your generation invented talking?! There used to be nothing but analysts and hippies running screaming on LSD about wanting to fuck their mothers. Well let me tell you I did fuck your mothers. And sometimes I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’m sorry. Alright? I’m finished. I’ll apologize as much as you fucking want, but I can’t get into everything. That’s it.",
"Fine. I apologize. Maybe I’m hungry. I’ve got nothing to hide. Let’s do it, c’mon. We can do it.",
For what?,
What’s he talking about?,
What was that?,
Send your guy. Send Colin. We should stay.,
"Great, fucking great. I was about to take business advice from a clown who jumps in the shallow end. And now everyone’s fucking off!",
What?,
"Look I want you to call Japan, we, have the office. I’m tickling Sandy on local. I want you to get into the government issues of it all with the launch deal.",
You’re COO aren’t you?,
You’re doing the call?,
Okay. Okay. Go.,
You’re late.,
And where have you been?,
"Uh-huh, that’s right.",
"I keep an eye on things, Shiv. I keep an eye.",
What’s wrong with him?,
Roman?,
You’d do that to me? Eavis? The one Senate member who wants to fuck me ragged? On the same side as those animals who hit me with a face full of piss!,
That’s not work. This is sabotage. Rebellion.,
‘Philosophy’. His philosophy is to take the bread from my mouth. This is a deliberate attempt to undermine my whole business strategy.,
Oh you too!,
"I took a few calls, Jesus, you can’t wait?",
You forced my hand. You’re lucky that was it. It’s part of the game.,
"Fine. I’ll shut it all down, the network, cable news. No acquisitions. No company. No way to distance yourself, would you like that? You run to politics to make out you’re your own man, fine, but that’s not principle. You’re scared to compete. You’re marrying a man fathoms beneath you because you don’t want to risk being betrayed. You’re a coward.",
You’re worse than the other two!,
"If I’d spoken to my uncle like that, he would—",
Get him out.,
Uh-huh.,
Uh-huh.,
Oh yeah? That’s nice. What a lovely guy.,
Shut the fuck up.,
So what’s going on? He’s selling me things I want at a fair price? What’s next?,
"So, if he does, we fuck him.",
"You screw them out, you chisel them out, you fucking hurt them. You make them squeal.",
Walk him to the elevator and tell him four-nine.,
Ugh. It’s the wheel.,
I hear you boys are headed out for Tom’s bachelor party?,
Huh.,
So listen. This party. Can you make sure Kendall doesn’t come home in a box?,
I don’t want him showing up dead at the bottom of some French fag’s swimming pool.,
Keep an eye on him for me. Is that something you can do for me?,
Tom? Tom can dish it out?,
"Take care of this for me, perhaps we’ll talk.",
"Hello, Pinky. Glad you kept the date.",
You know. People pretending to be people. How are the wedding preparations?,
Well I am excited. My daughter.,
They told me.,
They said.,
"Well tell him not to speak about my family. Not on my network and not on any network, ever again, or I’ll end him.",
I’m a bad father? How dare he? He’s a bad husband. He killed his fucking wife.,
Meh meh meh. Men change the world. Cowards complain. He’s using you. Can’t you see it? Don’t let a lot of bullshit overshadow the wedding okay?,
"C’mon, stop screwing around. Let’s talk. Come in. I’m tired of this. You have potential. I always thought you were the smartest.",
"You know, I’ve always taken care of you, Siobhan, and maybe I shouldn’t have. Maybe I should just let them come for you.",
"I hear things, Siobhan.",
I’m just curious if she’s going to come begging.,
I don’t want to ask. If she wants to ask she can ask.,
"Do  ask, Gerri, okay? If she comes crawling, then I’ll think about coming. What’s going on? Have you seen Caroline? Is she still with that chinless hippy prick?",
"So, what are we going to say?",
I don’t want to say illness. It plays weak. No.,
What sort of prick is too busy to go to his daughter’s wedding?,
Makes her look weak. Which makes me look weak. None of my kids have gone round the bend or topped themselves – I might have had my moments but—,
Because—,
Huh.,
Fuck it. There’s no way out.,
Hello.,
So. I’m ‘feeling much better’.,
So they gave this place a lick of paint?,
All very good. Everything’s good acquisition-wise. Just need to shut down the voice of the fucking people over there. Kendall.,
"So, what about it, son, shall we jump out of the trenches for a game of soccer? Can I bring you some corn to get you through the winter? So, how you doing? What’s the news?",
Need a reference for your resume?,
‘Relatively punctual’. ‘Prone to occasional bouts of insubordination’.,
So how long you gonna fuck about on the outside?,
How would a TV network suit you? One of the big guys? When I land it? Could that work?,
No I’m just a lovely guy.,
"Ah, Mr Fuckhead, I presume.",
So. Are we allowed to talk?,
Oh really?,
"Classy. Look, what have you got against me?",
"The interest of each is the good of all. That, is the whole of the law.",
"Uh-huh, kindergarten was it?",
"Sure. But what about – and this isn’t me talking, but what about me, Mr Fucking Ability, busting my chops in my auto shop just so some needy fuck in the projects can jack off on my time? That’s the issue, I’m afraid.",
"I didn’t make human nature. But I do know what they watch and what they read. I make my nut off of what people really want, so don’t tell me about people. I’d go flat bust in a week if I didn’t.",
Uh-huh.,
Right. Huh. Thanks.,
Thank you.,
Huh?,
I don’t know what you’re talking about.,
I don’t like being outside the US for too long.,
There’s a mercilessness I miss.,
Fucking without a rubber. Everywhere else feels soft. Look at this fucking place.,
"Refined. Ha! That? All of it. Slaves, cotton and sugar. This country was nothing but an off-shore factory for turning evil into hard currency.",
"Ha! Now it fucking lies here, living off the capital, sucking in immigrants to turn it and stop it from getting bedsores.",
"Oh, but doesn’t a deal feel so much better?",
"He’s a good man, Siobhan. He is. Episode Ten",
"Tell him if he wants to stop me buying papers and stations, he can fuck off, we’re good to go. Come through, son!",
Come in. I’m not on the can. Nice service right? Shame it wasn’t Catholic but there you go. Fucking all those kids will hurt the brand.,
Hello?,
What is it?,
Ugh?,
Huh?,
It’s— This is – a – fucking bear hug?,
Guh.,
Who?,
No. Fuck off. I haven’t got pants on! Do you even know what you’re doing this for?,
Uh-huh?,
You can’t even fucking say it.,
‘Do good things.’ Be a fucking nurse.,
Gerri! Where’s Gerri? Karl.,
"I need Gerri, I need Karl. I need—",
"Bear hug, then they’ll go— It’ll— A – hostile. It makes sense. It fits.",
"I don’t know. I don’t fucking know. It’s not a good position I am in. If he has financing, and major shareholders? And – I’m here. By tomorrow? I need – I need a lot of things I don’t have—",
And I’m tired. I’m tired.,
Cancel everything else. I fly out— Find out if I can leave now.,
"Options. Now. In three hours, in— Are my pilots on the clock— Check who’s got the hours to fly me home, or scheduled.",
Huh. Tomorrow maybe. Gerri? What’s the— Where are you on that—,
Tomorrow.,
Find out where that fucking shrunken Californian raisin is.,
Look at you.,
Oh for tonight? For tonight?,
Nuh. What the fuck! Jerk.,
Yeah well you did. Fucking prick. Do as you’re told. Go on – get out of here.,
"Stop mumbling. Don’t look at me. Fuck off. Where do you get these people, they’re fucking amateurs. Get out. I’m soaked through. Get him out I don’t want to see him again. Ever. Okay?",
"… I wouldn’t have missed this for the world. This is a very memorable day. A day I’ll never forget, as long as I live. I wanted it to be perfect. For my daughter. And it is. Nothing could ruin this. It means so much to be surrounded by everyone we love and trust and hold dear. Because nothing is more important than family.",
Uh-huh.,
Yeah.,
The others?,
No. Is there an advantage?,
Hello. How’s the torture going?,
"I don’t think there’s any reason not to, legal or otherwise?",
You don’t think you owe us an explanation?,
Ha! What have you had your whole life that I didn’t give you?,
"I blame myself. I spoiled you and now you’re fucked. I’m sorry, you’re a hothouse flower and you’re nothing. You’re curdled cream. Maybe you can write a book or, or collect sports cars – or something but for the world, no I’m sorry, you’re not made for it. You can’t stand it.",
"Hey, son.",
"Thanks, Colin. Did you have an acceptable evening?",
I was up all night organizing my defense.,
"Look. So, um. I don’t know if you know, but the caterer I had an issue with, he died last night?",
Did you know?,
"Right. Well. Look. Our guys, one of our guys found a keycard to your room near where this kid went into the water.",
"Uh-huh. And Amir saw you last night, rather damp. The police officers are here – with Caroline.",
Did you have anything stolen last night?,
"This kid, I think he might be a thief. Who broke into your room and swiped your card?",
"Let me handle this, son.",
I know the guys. They know our guys. They’re all good guys. We can let them know what was taken.,
"Look, this is all quite stressful. Why don’t you get in my car and we’ll drive you to the plane and you can just relax and maybe you should go and straighten out in the desert?",
Yeah. I think that would be good.,
Tell Sandy you’re out. Tell Stewy. The thing looks like a shit show. Go to the desert. Dry out. You’ve been off-balance.,
C’mon!,
Huh? You wanna suck my dick?,
Did you know? Shiv? Roman? Con? Did you know?,
Did you know he was going to do that? I was wondering.,
Uh-huh.,
"That’s bullshit, that’s fucking sanctamonious horseshit. It was a fucking play. It was a play, it was a fucking move, so don’t act like a stuck-up cunt to me because it won’t fucking wash!",
Okay. Action stations. I gave him a chance. Gerri. Let’s go.,
Right. But do we cooperate?,
And if I don’t want to pull my panties down so fast?,
Uh-huh?,
What’s our story?,
What do we think? How’s the price?,
Does it track? Do we fly home and push that?,
"I start saying sorry, picking at scabs, who knows where we end up. Class actions from opportunists. Admissions of wrongdoing, billions out the door.",
Get the Raisin. Let’s go to the top. Get the president. But gentle. Okay? Anything else?,
"Lunch? Swallow. We’re on fucking saliva and adrenalin till we get on a plane. Alright? No local food. I get the shits, we’re fucked. No illness!",
No. Fuck it. No. I don’t talk to the babysitter. You sound her out.,
Where’s Karl?,
Uh-huh.,
"Hey? Look, I’m not sure how much cover I have. What you think? Am I fucked?",
I need to talk to a lawyer on my position. Who’s a tough bastard?,
She did the hookers? Right.,
Could I get her?,
Could you get her for me?,
"Listen, cooperate or not, to keep the board sweet, I’m thinking I might have to take a step back?",
I don’t want to go back right now. You think that plays?,
"Okay. Gerri and Shiv and Roman are going back to manage New York. Make contacts. No need to go running back like a slapped girl, looks weak.",
"No, I can’t trust you, you stay with me, and Karl for board liaison. Tom here on ATN. Okay? I’ll make a call on the lawyer. I like Layo but let me think. Council of war on the plane! Go on, get the fuck back there, Tumbledown Dick.",
Con? Yeah. Very important. Can you – hold the fort here? Can you keep this – all secured?,
"So. This is where I’m landing. For Waystar, three white-shoe firms on retainer. And the next best five, let’s play footsie, see if we can tie them up with conflicts.",
Once I have my personal legal position figured out they’ll coordinate with corporate legal and crisis PR.,
"Calls in to my brother, Marcia. You two touch base with Senate and house surrogates, payroll commentators and friends. I want everyone lawyered up. Set a joint defense meeting with my counsel, and the Waystar lead firm to lock down our list of counsel for individuals. Tom, me to see editorial on anything on this across ATN and global cable and print outlets. We pressure-point other operations, the line is, don’t lean on this it’s bendy as fuck. Play it smart today and you won’t look a cunt tomorrow. Karl, I need to talk to the top-twelve shareholders in the next thirty minutes. Emergency board meeting ASAP and they’re going to be rolling for the next week, okay? Hugo, I imagine most of that is obvious and in train, right?",
It’s war. Fuck off. Good?,
But we throw them this. I’ll step back as CEO.,
"Obviously on operational matters I will expect to have informal input. So as I step back, temporarily. Who do we like as CEO? I don’t give a fuck. It’s nameplates. C’mon. Brain dump. Speak. Let a hundred flowers bloom! No comeback.",
"Karl, if you’ve got cleans hands it’s only cos your whorehouse also does manicures.",
Frank? You’re not trusted. You’re mashed potatoes.,
"Gerri is clean, right?",
"She was nowhere near cruises was she when – when, you know?",
Oh you like Gerri?,
"You playing the reverse banjo, son? You trying to black-spot her?",
"Oh you like Roman? And what about yourself, Tom?",
Kind of like family? Kind of new blood?,
Uh-huh. What about Shiv?,
You don’t think Roman’s ready?,
Is anybody ready? Was I ready?,
He’s not all fucking ‘meh meh meh’. Plus I’ll be pulling the strings. Right?,
Sure.,
Uh-huh.,
Okay?,
/ ROMAN Okay— / But—,
Nothing – you go.,
Uh-huh.,
"Nope. Thanks, kid. Thank you.",
You’ve given me food for thought.,
Where’s Shiv?,
Uh-huh.,
"Yes I want a fucking room. I’m about to eat dick for three hours straight, so yes I want a fucking room. I don’t need that.",
What now?,
"Go on, fucking say.",
"Tom, where is she? Ah?",
Where are you?,
"No. I need Connor steadied. I need Marcia. I need Shiv. I need Ray and Cyd and fucking … I need you showing your face for me, son.",
"No! Fuck that. No one talks to the snake. No. Keep Gerri close. Keep an eye on, ah? I trust you.",
"You know, it just had to be Gerri? For right now, for today, yeah?",
Any Shiv news?,
Impressive. Did he come in a chauffeur-driven tractor?,
Where is she? Ah? Have you spoken to Marcia? Is someone connecting?,
"Yes I want you to reach out, Hugo. I am stuck in quicksand. My family have disappeared. The world is wobbling here – does no one understand what the fuck is happening? I am losing juice. I can’t get the right fucking lawyer. The sky is falling in, so when I say something – it fucking ! We have to act on the fucking world, we have to act!",
Con. How ya doing?,
"I’m sorry, son. That’s – tough.",
"Well, thank you. And, look, I just wanted to say hello, you know, and thanks for holding the fort?",
"But look. Now we have a moment, about those words, maybe harsh words, on that tin can, on the boat, you know?",
Yeah. So. No harm done? I mean I’d like to help you out.,
"Well, uh-huh. Anything can happen. And just to say, you know, with everything, good to know I can rely on you, with Kenny going nut-nut?",
"No one talks to him, okay? You’re number one, kiddo, you know that.",
Thank you.,
I know.,
I’m okay.,
"Oh I don’t know. I’m not, you know, I’m not perfect. But I’m not a monster, so … can’t be that bad.",
What do you think? Am I toast?,
"It’s not a good time to be estranged, Marcia. The boy. Proxy battle?",
Uh-huh. I know.,
"You know I can’t eat shit, Marcia. I just can’t. But—",
I can sometimes – get distracted.,
I think I need to get back to the city. People need to see a little family unity.,
"You drop some bombs, you get burnt too, you know? Shiv?",
You got her?,
Was she there? Was she wobbling?,
Uh-huh.,
Uh-huh. Is she solid?,
"Uh-huh. Okay. Well, thank you, Tumbledown. I’m getting out of this shithole. We should be together.",
You couldn’t get out for your old man?,
Uh-huh. Good to see you Pinky.,
Woulda been nice to get the hug?,
Not for the shot. For the – for the hug.,
"So, what do we need to do here?",
I’d like to get you in now. Before the shareholder meet. High level. ‘President’.,
It means whatever you want it to mean.,
Someone at the top with – credibility.,
I just hope our Acting CEO isn’t getting too fucking acting.,
"Where the fuck is everyone? C’mon, let’s start – they can catch up, what’s on fire?",
"Who’s this, Mr fucking Headband having a cronut on my time? I hear Gerri is looking at the Israeli outfit?",
"No. I have, I have a shape of things in mind for that. GoJo, streaming and— Just kill that, thanks. You wanna check the chain of command? What does he mean, ‘plant a flag’, ah? Please don’t fucking hover.",
"Are you kidding? In here? That rat sets one foot inside this building, I’ll punch him in the nose. Okay?",
"Find out what this fuck is planning, I don’t want him between my teeth right now.",
"Yes! The rest of you, you should be out there, call him out on this!",
As in?,
Fine. Fine. But— let’s talk about what media to put the kids in. Okay? What else?,
"Sure. You want me to – come by, sprinkle some fuck-dust?",
Tell them to fuck off.,
Maybe I don’t do that dance?,
Fuck ’em.,
They can fuck off.,
Love and marriage.,
I can feel another million drain with every cluck from that henhouse.,
Lala.,
"So, did you see him?",
Is he gonna come in?,
"Uh-huh. Thank you. You know every day I don’t see you out there saying something, I think, does Shiv even like me?",
Yeah but my daughter? My only daughter.,
I dunno. Maybe I’d like you to draw a circle round him? Declare that your father isn’t some … dirty bastard. The truth maybe – about him.,
"I mean, do you trust me?",
On all this – hullabaloo.,
Yes we can talk.,
"Not even that bad. Health and safety, compliance. Few bad apples.",
What?,
Fine. Maybe there were some salty moves.,
"I want to keep you clean! I put Gerri in, but I can’t trust her. She’s optics. I need you. Look, I didn’t know about any of the – shit.",
You know how many emails I get a day? I don’t read my emails. I get action points.,
Shiv. The world is fucking rough. We ran a cruise line out of tin- pot ports registered in bongo-fucking-bongo hovels and—,
"And we poured millions in. And sure, did we play rough with the odd fucking union boss? Or some Moaning Minnie repeat litigant? I dunno, it was quarter of a century ago a lot of it. So yes, I’ve fought, for you and your brothers, but you’re not going to find a piece of paper that makes you ashamed of me. Okay?",
"Christ, it’s just a position, Shiv. There’s a million ways through this.",
I dunno. Bus employees to picket in DC. Run ads in media. Rally surrogates on television. Persuade opinion-formers we’re getting spatchcocked. Attack the administration in general. Go after the prosecutors individually.,
"I’m not saying we go that way, but let’s have a walk round the fucking buffet.",
Uh-huh.,
Uh-huh?,
"What’s your angle, Tom?",
"Well, it won’t come to that.",
But that’s it? You don’t want anything?,
"Okay. Well it won’t come to that. But thank you. Thank you, Tom.",
Hey! So. How you doing? MICHELLE-ANNE Great. Are you—? What are you doing down here?,
You were on with Mark right? Isn’t he the fucking best? MICHELLE-ANNE Sure. Yeah.,
"My son stands up and waves his dick in the air and the world’s meant to rearrange itself according to his liking. I don’t think so, right? MICHELLE-ANNE Right. I see. But are you gonna get more cooperative now that you’ve set the table?",
"It’s a witch-hunt. Prosecutors are gonna regret any time or money they spend on it. So. What does the old man think? MICHELLE-ANNE Well, he’s got poll numbers dancing in front of his eyes morning, noon and night. Someone shits in Wisconsin he’s worried it’ll float down the Mississippi and hurt his numbers in Iowa.",
"Relax. We’ve got his back! MICHELLE-ANNE Yeah well. That’s – great. I guess, you know, when this thing broke the whole thing was, ‘Logan Roy’s going down.’ But then you got this thing, some of our folks are like, ‘There’s no way Roy’s going down. President is gonna protect him. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN!’",
"People, they have no idea, right? They have these paranoid fantasies. MICHELLE-ANNE Yeah, you know, he’s always had a connection issue with the base so his room for maneuver is limited.",
I mean I don’t want you to do anything. MICHELLE-ANNE Right.,
What I want is – is nothing. Normal consideration and not to become the focus of some bullshit. MICHELLE-ANNE Right.,
Not favors. MICHELLE-ANNE Right.,
‘Right right right right.’ MICHELLE-ANNE What?,
"Look, the fact is I never ask for anything because that’s not the way I operate. But I would like to know no one’s gonna shit their pants if I hang tough? MICHELLE-ANNE Facebook is full of photos of you and the boss at CPAC and Davos. All the nice things you’ve said about each other? It hits demographics we have to worry about.",
If that Raisin hangs me out to dry I am quite willing to do the same to him. MICHELLE-ANNE Well if we’re going to be real maybe the president has not been feeling like your coverage has been very helpful or truthful lately?,
Well it could get a lot fucking worse? I did not want this to go like this. MICHELLE-ANNE We have the same – interest here. Can you lower the temperature? And I’ll see what I can do.,
Fucking rat. I’m gonna jam a Montblanc down his fucking throat. Kerry!,
"Get us Colin, get us building services. If he comes for me, I want him fucking cuffed.",
He’s fired!,
Where is he? Is he there?,
He walked into my building. I’m gonna kill him!,
"It’s just – so, insolent.",
Hey? Hey. What you in for?,
Good kid.,
"Keeping your nose out, ah?",
"Smart cookie, ah? Smart little fucking cookie, are you?",
I saw your little interview.,
"‘Oooh, I wuv my daddy.’ Hehehe.",
‘He’s so gweat. I wish I could snuggle him.’ I never figured you for a nancy. I’m fucking kidding. What was the fishing thing? I don’t remember.,
What?,
Tell them to fuck off.,
"What happens if—? Do we, can we call Southern District? Or— get Layo, get, get – get—? Can we stall? Shall I call Michelle-Anne?",
What did she do? She’s got no fucking acumen.,
Uh-huh. I am aware. What if we say come back tomorrow?,
"Cooperate. Open up, show them in.",
Okay.,
Come. Behave appropriately. Leave.,
What?,
Sure.,
Sandy and Stewy will settle. They still want a deal.,
Uh-huh. I think I need more people. More protection.,
"The Raisin owes me everything. And now I need a bit of fucking cover, the forgetful cunt’s gone AWOL. I’m starting to feel we have perhaps been insufficiently rigorous, journalistically, on the president?",
"Every time I call I get Michelle-Anne telling me ‘be patient the cavalry will come’. I need leverage. Just the question, is he losing focus. How’s his grip?",
Ugh. Everyone sees I’m in a corner and they all want a piece.,
"Everyone’s out of their box. Everything’s coming up fuck. You’re my eyes and ears, Shiv. I want you on fire-watch. Okay?",
"Watch the negotiations. Karl’s a sharp bastard, but he wants to be liked. It’s not good. Fuck’s sake!",
Christ. The only place I’m not getting fucked right now is in the bedroom.,
"Ah, Greg. Drink?",
"Kerry, can we get Greg some ‘Coca-Cola’?",
"No no, what Greg wants, Greg must have. So. How are we doing?",
We’re just talking.,
"You’re hanging around with Kendall a lot, correct?",
"The thing is, your position at Waystar, it becomes complicated if you get too associated with him. You can see that?",
"You know the FBI have been poking around in my office. Greg, you’ve probably never been through something like this. We are all very concerned about you. I don’t want to see you get hurt. We need our lawyers all working together, one big happy family. A joint defense agreement. Big strong umbrella, keeps you dry.",
Well I have the paperwork here for you to sign up. —,
‘What’s it worth’?,
Well. What do you want?,
That’s not how it works.,
"Look at you, shaking like a fucking leaf! Listen, you’ve got some leverage, just a little, so why don’t you fuck off, think what you want to ask for to come on-side, and I’ll see what I can do, okay?",
Where is he? Where’s his car?,
He can fuck off.,
It’s Gourmando or fuck off.,
Josh. How’s your daughter?,
Not at all. I know how it is.,
"Hello, son.",
It was fine. It was nothing.,
Uh-huh. Sure.,
‘Concerns.’,
"Look, I can tell you, hand on heart with fifty years of business experience, that whatever the turbulence short term there is nothing that is a significant issue. The core business is the core business and the volatility is priced in now, it’s all upside from here so, the safest option, is to back me, sit tight counting your gold in your castle out here while I make you whole, okay?",
"All things must pass. Fucking, everything’s coming up roses. Right, son?",
Look at this fucking New York wiseacre.,
Uh-huh. A walk. How far?,
Sure. Let’s take a walk.,
What?,
"Yeah I’m okay. When I got here, what were you talking to him about?",
He’s watching us.,
"Yeah well he is. The pitch is we both want what’s best for the firm. In all families there are fights, but this is an opportunity to move forward stronger.",
"It’s good, son, thank you. She’s feeling better ah?",
"So, how about you just tell me what you want and I’ll see if I can give it to you and we can fuck off?",
Stick with us – you stick with the value proposition. This is the industry vision. Right here.,
Good band.,
Has Stewy run many major media companies?,
Sandy’s mashed potatoes.,
"Ambition? What, buy the company, hacksaw it and sell? Fucking genius.",
I’m still hungry. Lots of ways through this.,
Sure. It’s an option. But what I also see is the value in despised assets. That’s cream you can get fat on. I’m a printing press for greenbacks and I don’t give a fuck what anyone on god’s green earth thinks of me.,
You should listen to him.,
Uh-huh.,
You should tell him about Justin Albescu. That’s a funny story. Your brother was just telling me?,
I don’t know. Maybe.,
Uh-huh.,
I want her looped in to learn the ropes.,
Fine. I’ll speak with Siobhan.,
I just spoke to Karl.,
Karl’s not happy with your level of input.,
I don’t need another toothache.,
"I gave you a destination, I can’t walk you there, okay?",
"Nothing’s a line. Everything, everywhere is always moving forever, okay? Get used to it.",
"No I don’t want to eat the beach grass, thank you, Josh. Everything okay?",
"So, Josh. Where are we on this? Because you know I have a wife at home— —",
It ends with me in control. Slapped wrists and a payout. That stuff— sea mist. Vapor.,
Uh-huh. It’ll be okay.,
Uh-huh.,
It’ll be okay.,
"It’ll be okay, because he’s a good kid.",
Yeah he’s a good kid.,
"He did what he thought was best, I think he went too far but he’s a good kid.",
Yeah.,
"He’s a good kid and I love him. There’ll be a big number, we’ll pay, he’ll mew and cry and I get it. It’s all okay. And maybe it’ll be him, one day, because it’s in his blood and he learnt it all from me. He’s maybe the best one of all of them. So yeah it’s going to be okay.",
Well sounds good. I’d consider all that. Absolutely.,
Oh yeah? City boy ah? You’re a bit far from your nearest coffee and a bagel!? Haha.,
What?,
I’m good.,
"Yeah, well, you’ll say anything to get fucked on a date, won’t you? You know, Greg’s with me now. He tell you that? You’re on your own, son. —",
You’d scuttle the fleet in a month.,
"You know something, son? I’d rather get fucked by a spic in a shower block than see you have it. I’ve got the Raisin, under my thumb. I’ve got the family. I’ve got little Greggy, I’ve got this fucking tattoo-man in the tank, you’re high and dry. Face it son, you lost— Sssssssssshhhhhh.",
I’m great. You go.,
Stop staring. I’m fine.,
Huh—? Bumps. I’ve walked bumps—,
"No no. Not just for me. Not on my account. Right, Ken—? —",
I’m fine—,
I beat you – pipe down.,
You’re fucked.,
Let’s close the deal with Josh—,
Fuck off.,
You got – water?,
Get me something – in case I puke.,
Tell him yeah—,
"Fuck off – I know what heart attacks are, this isn’t one—",
No – we’re not getting a fucking doctor – not in front of him—,
I’m not dying – you’re trying to fuck me in front of him—,
You made me walk the extra— You tried to fuck me—,
Fuck off – I just need to have a word.,
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well I’m sorry. I don’t control them like that. He has editorial freedom. C’mon, this is just rumors. Watch the show, I’m sure it won’t be so bad? You want to hear what it sounds like when the president loses his temper? — You want to hang up on him? Look, let me investigate. It’s just, you know Mark. Very tenacious. Very independent. I dunno, maybe if I wasn’t so tied up with this fucking investigation, I could focus on keeping ATN on-message? Uh-huh?",
Hm. Might need a piss.,
"What do you think, Colin? Is this it?",
"Will you sit out front today, K? I need to know what the temperature is amongst the shit-munchers?",
Uh-huh.,
"Gerri, Karl?",
Uh-huh. Okay. Yes.,
What about the Raisin?,
"Good. Press for something, a statement. Rumor of a statement. Anything before the vote that looks like a win and turns the DOJ temperature down.",
Why are they suddenly looking to settle?,
Have they had bad news? What do they know that we don’t?,
Uh-huh. But I’m not gonna go do a tap-dance. Shiv. Gerri. Karl. Romulus. Go report back.,
Frank – we nail you to the cross out there.,
"It’s tight, son. Later.",
What?,
You’ve never been interested.,
I can’t do ancient history.,
I’m just not sure you have – the track record?,
Like what?,
Where’s the john?,
They could’ve said yes in Greece. Saved us all the ballache.,
"Uh-huh. If it’s good for them, maybe it’s bad for us?",
They were always gonna settle. Something’s screwy. Do we give ’em a taste of their own medicine? Make some tweaks – let everyone know they bent for me?,
Tell him he can’t set foot in the building?,
Pills.,
What do you think?,
About the deal. Settling?,
Um? I need a piss. Shiv?,
You. Let’s go.,
Yeah? Uh-huh. Of course. We need to get back.,
Uh-huh.,
Fuck ’em. Fuck ’em.,
Pills.,
What’s going on with the—? Reagan. The Raisin?,
Can we get Ravenhead on the air?,
Call Michelle-Anne and let’s get the SEC to shut this meeting down.,
Where is he? I need a piss?,
Huh? Give me a hand.,
"Thanks, son.",
We should have chopped him down.,
Four seats? And the Raisin gone. What if we get a more aggressive DOJ?,
I need to see all the detail.,
That’s what people on the shitty end of a deal always say. Four seats?,
It doesn’t matter. Not that.,
I’d have figured it out. Time to think about next moves.,
There’s blood in the water. The sharks are coming. We should hustle on acquisitions.,
"Shiv, I’m trying to talk to Gerri about something important. Stop fucking buzzing in my ear!",
Can you block this number for me?,
Yeah? Heheh.,
"Hey, Romulus!",
Okay! Hugo?,
Regulate and strangulate. They’re too powerful. Everybody knows it.,
Uh-huh. Get your beak out singing that song.,
We kick the tires on GoJo.,
"I am not saying go back to the fucking abacus, Siobhan, I am saying, fair competition.",
"I might have heard the DAG has a picture of me on her dartboard, which is disgusting.",
You gonna be a fuckin’ sourpuss?,
It was a long day and I was unwell.,
You’re scared of Dave Boyer?!,
Well I want them to win. I don’t like your bunch of mimsy can’t- say-that fucks.,
I need to keep my spoon in the soup.,
He’s maturing.,
He’s a good kid. He’s fun.,
"How is he, the Raisin? MICHELLE-ANNE How is he? He’s out of a job in six months, lame in the interim and the GOP’s in flames. We’re all doing backflips.",
"He’s got a serious condition. We felt the country needed to know. MICHELLE-ANNE Oh, it’s a public service? Your country thanks you. My life is hell.",
Dave is good. I like Dave. MICHELLE-ANNE We all like Dave.,
More a misunderstanding.,
"But still, for the best. We can’t have a president who smells toast and shits in the waste basket.",
Mm.,
No – is it bad?,
Can he stop?,
Uh-huh? Squinty-face? Ohio fourteenth?,
Dave! How are we?,
Uh-huh? Well here we are?,
I wouldn’t worry about all that.,
Oh that’s interesting? That’s really interesting?,
"Uh-huh. You heard this thing, the DAG has a dartboard with my face on it?",
Okay. Good!,
I don’t care about the résumé. Or ideological purity. So long as they get it and they pop.,
"Sure, I could see Connor.",
"Okay, so. Come in. Come in.",
Just keep your trap shut. Watch.,
"Right. There’s a lot of chaff flying, lot of flapping but Ron and me are gonna have brunch and figure out how to pull for the same name. We need one voice on this, or we could fall apart and hand it to the fuck-fuck donkey gang. So. Who do we like?",
Exactly. We’re picking. — We do not have all night.,
Tom? Who do you like?,
"Look, end of the day, aside from the business, this crop of Dems, they want to pull everything down but that can’t put up a fucking tent. They’re zealots, and they believe in magic, that some words are bad magic. Fuck ’em.",
To Bertie Woofter?,
You’re kidding. The fucking seat-sniffer? He’s been hanging round for forty years.,
We have to be united. It’s a disaster if we splinter.,
What?,
"I mean, what about Con?",
I could see it.,
Kids?,
"I mean, he’s a good-looking kid. He’s smart, in his way. Fucking Joe Kennedy did it for his boys? Get him in there on a smile and a shoeshine, get Ron and everyone behind him?",
"Shiv, as a political consultant how would you rate him?",
He can walk and chew gum. He pisses pretty straight.,
Reagan was outstanding but it was skin deep. You don’t have to be fucking Thomas Jefferson. Index cards and a team. Greg – would you vote for Connor?,
Honestly?,
"Shiv? What do you think, is it nuts?",
Okay. And I’m still curious about— Hugo? Can you call Boyer?,
Speakerphone.,
"Dave, it’s Logan. How are you?",
"Oh, fine. Listen, I’m in my suite. Would you fancy dropping by?",
Uh-huh. —,
"Great, Dave, and listen. My fridge is bare. Don’t suppose you could run me over a Coke?",
Yeah. Just a Coke.,
If you don’t have a Coke maybe there’s something else?,
Maybe you could fire the deputy attorney general?,
"I’m kidding, Dave! But listen, would you come over for a chat? Is it convenient?",
"Uh-huh. Well thanks, Dave. You’ve certainly given us a lot to think about.",
"Tom. You’re a good Midwestern mulch cow, who do you like?",
Thank you.,
That was nice.,
The climate said I was going down. The climate said I should just step aside. I guess I’m a climate denier.,
Goodnight.,
Good. Sunday show pushed him this morning. Let’s see if this horse can run.,
Uh-huh.,
"Fine. Yeah, get Tom on it. Tell him to fill the trough for all the little piggies.",
Siobhan!,
Family photo.,
We’re all going to be in it. Let’s go.,
"Get in the photo, please. Siobhan, are you a part of this family or not?",
"Fine. You win, Pinky. You win. Nice going this weekend, son. Episode Seven",
‘Long road ahead’.,
It’s going to be a number.,
And to justice!,
I’ll remember.,
"Yeah, it’s off. Tell these kids to fuck off. Meeting’s cancelled.",
If he wants to send a nobody.,
"He’s going to this fucking party, isn’t he? Ah? Where is he? Getting his nails done, asshole whitened?",
"Everyone’s telling him he’s hot. He thinks he’s it. Nah, it’s bad fucking juju to start like this.",
No. We’ve got options.,
Frank’s reached out to Nan about Pierce.,
Alright. Enough. Everyone back to work! The deal makes sense. I like the deal. But he won’t make the deal because he’s an arrogant prick.,
"It’s just smart business, Shiv. I don’t want to pay over the odds. And eventually the market will make him make the deal.",
"Kerry? What was it, the thing you said about Matsson?",
It’s good tactics.,
You’re going? Fine. But – do not overplay. This thing is a black box. I don’t want to overpay.,
Since you’re going – you can give him the card in person.,
Welcome. How you doing? How’s your dad?,
"Sure. Send him my best. Finally made it into my fucking castle and he’s too sick to show up, huh? Still. You’re here, so that’s nice.",
"I didn’t want to bother you until there was some protein. I know how busy you both are, with all your— various activities.",
We’re not ambushing you we’re—,
I love my business but we’ve had our throats slit on ads for twenty years. We’re bleeding out. Another five of cord-cutting and we’ll be dead on the fucking carpet. This is a transformative deal.,
Things moved very fast. It’s all very sensitive but from now on we’ll be sure to keep you—,
"Okay, shall we?",
Matsson is a visionary.,
He has a team we can do business with.,
"Well look, if you guys really don’t like it, sure, kill it.",
"Wonderful, great thoughts. Very helpful perspective. You’ve given us lots to think about. Many thanks.",
"Yeah, fuck off, ghost.",
"Yup, Gerri, will you give them some plastic sheriff badges and send them off to eat beans and fart somewhere, yeah? Okay. So, look, I like the shape of this. But if we’re going for it, I don’t have a relationship with Matsson. I don’t like him and he doesn’t like me. So, Roman, I need you as the pointman because every other person here is one million years old, right, Ger? Can you do it? Can you land this fucking fish for me?",
No little jokes?,
Good. And get a fucking haircut.,
No. No. I’m coming. We’re going.,
"Nah, I’m coming. Why not? I’m probably paying for the fucking thing!",
How you doing? Staying ahead of the Inland Revenue?,
"Glad to be here. Anything I can do, just let me know.",
"Wonderful woman. Don’t give her access to your noggin, or your accountant.",
Uh-huh?,
Him? He wants me to get the dipshits of Downing Street to make him Lord fucking Seat-Sniffer of Pantyhose. You see the tweet? Have you spoken?,
What’s the decode. What’s his game? Is he trying to make us pay more.,
Yeah well I’m not used to negotiating via eggplant. I’m not sure he wants the deal. He might just want a fucking moussaka.,
We’ll get back to him.,
Should I go?,
I’m across a lot of shit. She’s monitoring.,
"Few things off the menu for me, health-wise.",
I think we brought some dishes over that are good for me?,
So. What is this? Because I have things to do.,
GoJo price is spiking. Your pal Matsson’s got a screw loose.,
"Your whole generation is kaput. All about the clicks. You need to put your phones away, make some money and shut the fuck up.",
"Well, I can’t get into everything now, so if it’s going to be a lot of bullshit I’ll just go. Let’s be civil and not pull our guts out all over the table alright?",
Where are the kids?,
Iverson! I’d like to say hello.,
"Hey, kiddo. How you doing? Do you like mozzarella?",
Here. Try this.,
"There you go, kiddo. Try that.",
Off you go. Go on. Kerry’s got something for you in there I think.,
"Uh-huh. How is the boy. Is he, better?",
The nanny game?,
Little shits. Did I know that?,
Okay?,
Life isn’t knights on horseback. It’s a number on a piece of paper. It’s a fight for a knife in the mud.,
Uh-huh.,
Uh-huh.,
I’ll have to think.,
"Well, that was for – fun.",
"It doesn’t necessarily work for me. It doesn’t look good, maybe, you leaving.",
"Maybe I want you around, you can do the mail. Keep you rattling around?",
Maybe.,
"Hm, well?",
Don’t talk about what you don’t understand.,
And I thought I was just telling folks the weather?,
"Just notice, did you?",
Fuck off.,
"Not everyone can live this life. I’m a great revolutionary. A – a – bit of fucking spice. A bit of fun, a bit of truth.",
"I fucking know things about the world, or I wouldn’t turn a buck.",
Not necessarily nice things.,
Uh-huh.,
"How long was that kid alive before he started sucking in water, do you think? Couple of minutes? Three, four, five minutes in there? Long time, two minutes. What were you even doing? Chasing a piece of tail? Are you queer? Were you gonna fuck him? Or was it just for drugs?",
Sure.,
"So. Before we get the whole three-ring circus in here, just amongst friends I wanted to get a sense of what’s going on? Is he a Twitter panty-flasher? Or is he a serious person?",
But the guy isn’t a fuckhead?,
He’s not a big baby who shits for clicks?,
Cos I can win any bout with a boxer fuck but I don’t know how to knock out a clown.,
No such thing.,
Hm.,
"We can’t afford to walk away right now. Got to be worth a conversation, son.",
Bring them in. Let’s get the fucking bankers in here on this.,
"Yeah well, that’s obvious.",
I don’t get it?,
Yeah?,
Is he just—? Is it just – Roman being Roman?,
"Uh-huh. Sure. Sure, Pinky. Go on. Roman!",
Are you a sicko? What is this? Why do you send them?,
Uh-huh – as a – as a fuck you?,
People send each other pics of their dicks?,
"We publish a number of popular newspapers, so yes, son, we probably invented the fucking words. But why?",
Uh-huh? Have you got a problem? What aren’t you with that nice piece of tail?,
What interests you in Gerri exactly?,
"I don’t like things going on I don’t know about. She’s a million years old. It’s fucking disgusting. You’re a laughing stock. Go on, fuck off.",
Well I don’t want her hanging round like frozen fucking piss.,
"‘Mog was tired. She was dead tired. Her head was dead tired. Her paws were dead tired. Mog thought, “I want to sleep forever.”’ Isn’t this a bit young for you?",
"I think this is a bit kiddie for you. This isn’t for grown-up boys. Let’s get you a proper book. You alright, kiddo? Your dad was okay, you know? He’s okay.",
"Kerry! Can you bring us a book, something with some action! What? Careful now. Talk to me. Gerri! Where are you, Gerri! Monopoly",
No.,
"Go on, Karl, what?",
I’m gonna go see Matsson and get inside this!,
"No, you stay here and play with your dick.",
"I’m kidding. No c’mon, Tumbledown. He’s your pal. Let’s go see Hans Christian Anderfuck, see if he’s been telling us fucking fairytales.",
"Uh-huh. Good-looking woman, ah?",
"So, look, what is it, son? Are you scared of pussy? Is it all screens or up the ass with you or what?",
"Oh, not at all. So. What you think? Are we doing this fucking merger or not?",
Yeah well. You know. I’m old. What? You want a bit of ‘nice house you got here’?,
"Well, everything’s fucking boring isn’t it?",
Except this.,
"Yeah but how interested? Look, I just don’t want to fuck around forever with this. I’ve seen what’s happening to your price. And I understand your board will need to look at all the options. But if we stay tight we can work this, so— shall we dance, or what?",
Betting? Subscription numbers?,
So what does that mean?,
Uh-huh.,
Uh-huh. Got a kid in Malaysia reading history for him now?,
And you don’t have the content.,
What’s your churn like?,
You want me to get in your sauna and tell you what a pretty pecker you got?,
Well me too.,
"Well it’s something you say isn’t it? No. I am excited but— America. I dunno. When I arrived, they were these gentle giants smelling of fucking gold and milk, and they could do anything. Now you look at them, fat as fuck or scrawny on meth or yoga. They pissed it all away. I don’t know. Go on. Talk to me.",
Uh-huh.,
You’re not fucking serious.,
But you’d rule the roost and it would be your board?,
Uh-huh.,
"It’s okay, son.",
I’m not telling you what I’m fucking thinking!,
I don’t see it. I don’t see how I swallow this.,
Yeah. This is not happening.,
"Why not. Rome, you should head back, for your mom and everything.",
Send them in! Hey. Hello hello! What’s all this then?,
"Of course! Things have moved fast. Come in, come in.",
"Look at you three. Why so grave? The three little piggies. Come on, we’re family, take a seat.",
"Okay well, I’m looking at a few options. Let’s settle down and I can explain.",
"Absolutely. I was about to be in touch. But do you mind – not with him in here giving me the fucking doggy-evils? Can you take him out, Romulus? I’ll fill your sister in then give you the angles. I can’t trust him. Roman?",
I thought we had this figured out?,
"Okay. So. The market capitalizations of our firms have been on the move. The DOJ fine is going to be very very large – thanks, Ken. We are a declining business and there are a wave of consolidations happening that mean this is the optimal moment, in my opinion, to make a deal with a serious tech operation like GoJo. So that is what I am exploring. Okay?",
That’s a long way down the road. It’s a merger.,
"Well, it’s maybe more complicated in this case. But yeah, the numbers might mean I relinquish control of certain elements.",
"Well, no, it needs to be now.",
Because I feel it in my bones.,
"Yeah well, end of the day that’s all I’ve fucking got.",
"This is the best moment to sell and if I don’t do the best deal at any given point, what’s the point of anything, ah? I don’t get out now, I leave several billion on the table.",
"I’m confused, Pinky, because I thought we were dead if we didn’t make a deal? See this is why I had to keep you outside. Too much, hot blood and cold piss sloshing around.",
Yeah. Why?,
Make your own fucking pile. Look. I know this is a readjustment. But our blood’s in the water and I need to make moves fast if I want to stay in control of the situation and get myself – and you – assurances – about the future.,
No! Nah. He rates you. This is an opportunity for you kids to get an education in real life.,
"Well maybe not you, Ken. But, Rome, Shiv. In five, ten years …",
"Trust me. I’ll still be in the mix. I can pull the strings. I’m gonna be around for a decade. Don’t burn any bridges, okay? Don’t listen to the Whisky Sour here, Santa Claus will figure it out for you.",
"Roman. C’mon, let’s get away from the fucking Jacobins, let’s discuss, I’ve got you. C’mon.",
"He rates you. You have my word. This is an opportunity, son. Bit of fucking grit. Adversity. Like me. You can trust me.",
And what will you do if I decide I can’t listen to you?,
"You’re playing toy fucking soldiers! Go on, fuck off, all of you. I have you beat, you morons.",
‘Well no because …’ She still on—?,
Can we get her back?,
Hello—?,
"Caroline, you’re on with Kendall, Roman and Siobhan.",
"I thought we should have a brief family conversation, about the accommodations we’ve come to. Shall I speak on our behalf—?",
Your mother and I have reviewed the terms of the divorce agreement—,
"and we’ve agreed that some of the arrangements were a little, antiquated—",
‘Please’? The seat-sniffer gets his fucking leg up. That’s a deal. What have you got in your fucking hand?,
"‘Love’. You’re coming for me with love? You bust in here with guns in your hand but now you find they’re fucking sausages you want to talk about ‘love’? You should have trusted me. I’m a lamb, I’m a fucking lamb.",
"‘Why’? Because it works. I fucking win. Come on, fuck off out, you nosey fucking pedestrians!",
Munsters. Meet the fucking Munsters. And who the fuck is this now?,
We gonna square this away?,
They eat their own. Savages.,
Uh-huh.,
Cyd’s trying to screw you out. Spreading poison.,
She’s a monster. She’ll be feeding you broken glass before we close the deal.,
Heard from the rats?,
Good. And you seen Greg’s piece?,
Uh-huh?,
If you and Shiv bust up?,
You’ll figure it out.,
"If we’re good, we’re good.",
Uh-huh. Little piggies. Stuffing their faces. Why is everyone so fucking happy?,
"I’ve got done a huge fucking deal at exactly the right time. I’ve got ATN plus Pierce, I’ve got the election. I’ve got plenty on my plate.",
I thought there might be a churchman?,
I thought a cardinal was mentioned. Bit of fucking class. What about Jeryd?,
Whoop-de-doop.,
When’s she calling?,
Can’t eat a fucking thing here. What you having?,
Uh-huh. You’re a good guy.,
You’re my pal.,
You’re my best pal.,
I mean what are people?,
What are people?,
They’re economic units. I’m a hundred feet tall. These people are pygmies. But together they form a market.,
"What is a person? It has values and aims. But it operates in a market. The marriage market, the job market, the market of ideas, et cetera.",
"Everything I try, people turn against me. A person is a person, but what is— Is this the place where the cheesecake is good?",
"Nothing tastes like it used to, does it? Nothing’s the same as it was, is it? Do you think they put something in things?",
I had a burger the other day that tasted so—,
It was fine. I dunno. Do you think there’s anything after all this? Afterwards?,
"I don’t think so. I think this is it, right?",
Uh-huh. Being realistic though?,
Who’s crawling out of the woodwork? Ah? Who is it?,
What?,
What? What’s the issue?,
Uh-huh.,
"Uh-huh? Call your wife, Tom. Call your fucking wife and tell them they need to get their own fucking idea. It’s pathetic. Tell her she’s never had a single fucking idea in her whole fucking life! What?!",
What? What else now? Ah?,
Is it the kids? What does she want?,
"Well, what can I fucking say? Uh-huh. No one makes jokes anymore do they? Karl, you got any jokes?",
"I was saying: this is a bit dry, Karl, have you got any jokes?",
"Fucking dry as dust. Do an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman.",
Uh-huh. Come on. Let’s have some fun? Why don’t you roast me? Ah? Give me a fucking drubbing. Frank. Start. Be funny.,
You don’t think I can take it?,
Uh-huh.,
Fucking Sid Caesar here. Karl?,
Tom?,
Greg?,
"Who wants to smell Greg’s finger? Ah? Guess the scent and win a buck. Come on, roast me!",
"Where’s your dad, ah? Sucking cock at the county fair?",
"Come on, Karl. Call me a dumb old queer.",
"Why you so fat, Karl? Ah?",
"Hehehe. Exactly. Gerri? Got sent anything funny lately, Gerri? Ah?",
"I’m not being horrible, I’m being fun! Fucking Munsters. At least I’m not being boring. I don’t know why you’re smiling, fucking golden parachutes. Where’s your wife, Tom?",
Uh-huh.,
Uh-huh.,
I’m thinking. Is she talking to them?,
Okay. Okay. Hold on. Kerry. I might need input.,
"She doesn’t like me. They like you. Tell her, what? We anchor at seven?",
Yeah? Not too insulting?,
Let’s do six – but like you’re kidding around.,
Six. Find something we lost conviction on. Just to fucking let her know we’re not Terry Turnip Truck over here.,
"What are they up to, you think?",
"I don’t want to lose this, Tommy.",
Excuse me?,
Tell them I’m willing to go up.,
That’s bullshit.,
Fucking geniuses. Ten?,
"I just watched the top of the hour and it’s bullshit. Jiménez got a sound bite that ran fifteen fucking seconds. And who the fuck is this lunk? People watch at night, you know? I watch at night.†",
"Are you losing it, Cyd, ah? Are you fucking losing it? *  We had to cut this glimpse of how Naomi and Kendall’s relationship developed for time. †  By the time we shot this scene we had written the piece of news Logan was watching so were able to tailor his lines specifically to the images. Episode Two",
How am I feeling? Fucking great! Why do people keep asking how I’m feeling?! I’m selling. My decision. Feeling great. And yes. Yes we axe that chopper. They can fucking walk.,
One email? Fucking Stakhanovites in here. Don’t exhaust yourself will you?,
Pretty fucking penny. It’s a fucking aircraft hangar. What’s the air-con bill?,
Where is she?,
"So, you two looked at the tape?",
Have you watched Kerry’s tape? What did you think?,
Yes?,
"Oh no no no no, kiddo. You go first.",
Smart. Nice.,
Oh? You did?,
"Oh I’m keeping out! She’s my assistant. It would be very unprofessional for me to get involved. Whatever you two geniuses think. Right. I wanna talk to them, little speech?",
No need for a song and dance. Cheap and cheerful.,
Uh-huh. Who am I gonna sue? Myself. You wanna do an intro? Sprinkle some sugar?,
Oooooh.,
"Evening, all! So. Fifteen percent up. Year-on-year? It’s a shame we’re up forty on costs. Still I guess it evens out. Does it? Is fifteen equal to forty, pal?",
Is fifteen equal to forty?,
What’s going on?,
Uh-huh. And what the fuck were you laughing at?,
"Okay. Fine. What are the options? I don’t know if I want to shake his hand, he’s been a fucking prick about the spin-off.",
"It seemed to be working, give it a go.",
Nah. I don’t want to be standing around like fucking set dressing.,
It’s – all this pizza.,
"Uh-huh. Why am I looking at all this pizza? Is this place out of control, Tom? No more fresh pies, right? They’re sending out for fresh pies and this is three or four here that are perfectly good and it could go in the microwave.",
"Greg, fuck off. Look, it’s not the pizza, it’s the culture. I’ve been thinking. About Kerry.",
You think she’s the finished article?  –,
No?,
Interesting.,
"That’s smart. You’re smart. Let her down gently, yeah?",
I’m not involved. Okay? I’m nowhere near this. I know nothing.,
Hey.,
Hey.,
"Okay, listen, let’s go somewhere. The lights. I could have a seizure.",
Fine. Very well.,
So let’s get this figured out. Then I can let you get back to your fun.,
Well I’ve got something to say.,
"Look. It’s not … Leaving that, aside. I wanted to say I guess. I wanted you there, a bit – at my party.",
It could maybe have been nice.,
You knew I wanted Pierce. From way back. So losing out on— That was not a good feeling.,
"Look, you’re smart to ask for more money. You are. But Matsson won’t go there. You’ve been outside this. I’ve got to a good deal. And you get enough to do what you want. I’ll do ATN, you’ll do Pierce. It’ll be a fresh start for us. It’ll make things better. And it’s right there. All you need to do is vote ‘yes’ and support the deal.",
Enough. I thought you’d be interested in an apology but that’s enough.,
"Look, I don’t do apologies. But – you know. If it matters to you. Sorry.",
"Well, I’m sorry about the helicopter for a start.",
"Yes okay, I guess I’m— I’ve got certain – thoughts about— Look, out of the best of intentions, I got the structure of – the holding company, the ownership structure of the family trust – has meant there’s been a lack of clarity, so maybe you got certain impressions? But I saw it differently so …",
You blew up over a by-law. But maybe that’s on me.,
"Tom asked my advice. He spoke to someone I recommended. You weren’t around. If you’d been around I would’ve given you the same advice. I can’t help you if you won’t see me. Look, bottom line, if we ask for more, Matsson walks. I know it.",
Fine. I’ve actually— And I didn’t want to tell you like this. But. The truth is. I have something.,
A growth. They did tests. And it’s cancer.,
"Now, I don’t want to talk about it.",
I’m not getting into it. But that is one of the reasons I want this done.,
"Oh that’s nice, that’s charming. I’ve had fucking cancer.",
I’ve got it. I’ve had it. I’ll be okay. But I want to move.,
You want me to bend over so you can prod my fucking prostate? I’m fine. I’ve been under the knife? Not that you care.,
"Oh, I’m sorry my cancer isn’t big enough for you.",
It was an issue. I’m okay now. But it makes you think?,
It was a scare.,
I’m trying to get us back together. You kids need to realize.,
We need this deal. The world likes it. It makes sense. But deals fall apart every day. Because pricks like Matsson get pissed off or snubbed. This is fucking real.,
But why?,
Oh come on.,
"You’re fucking dopes. You’re not serious figures to me. I love you, but you’re not serious fucking people.",
Not good. Defiled my home. Indelicate with Kerry?,
I just don’t want to see him so much. Okay? In the freezer.,
"Well that’s interesting, Tom.",
"Oh, we know what they’re like. I’ve pushed the board meeting. I want you to come see Matsson with me. I could use your help.",
ATN’s getting leaner. Cyd thinks she knows it all. She’s on eight digits. Her sushi bill could fund a news chopper. There’s a Night of the Long Knives coming. I need a fire-breather. A ruthless fuck who’ll do whatever it takes?,
Sure. He’s got a face. Tom’s the meat locker.,
"Son, every time you say what’s true they’ll roll their eyes.",
You’re not Pierce. Perimenopausal professors and pollution of the Ganges? You’re ATN. I can’t do it all again from scratch. You’re afraid you get left with nothing?,
What you’re doing right now is how you get left with nothing.,
Smart people know what they are.,
"More, Romulus. I need you.",
"Tom? Roman might help me when I have a question, yeah?",
"Hey so, son, I was thinking, we could hold for you? You wanna come see the Swede. Get inside this? It could get fucking brutal.",
"C’mon. He likes you, you’ll keep it – light.",
It’ll be okay.,
Mmmmh. But let him know will you? Let him know I’ll call when I have a minute. If I get one. Send him my best. Then you could be over in twenty?,
Uh-huh. We got him some Napoleon thing sent. He’ll be okay.,
You should.,
Well maybe today. I need you. And I wouldn’t be fucking going if it wasn’t for you.,
"Cross the Rubicon, Romulus.",
"And listen. One thing and another, you know what’s happening. The clear-out? Cyd?",
"I’m feeling now more and more. I’m uncomfortable with Gerri. How she handled things. On the DOJ number, on the spin-off.",
Yeah. I think we want to let her go.,
So will you give her the heads-up?,
Yeah. Be nicer coming from you. I know you were close.,
"I mean, you are with me? You weren’t fucking me around?",
Uh-huh. What you got me on Matsson?,
Well that’s not on the table.,
"Uh-huh. And listen, I think today’s the day. I’ll talk to Cyd.",
Uh-huh. And Gerri. Will you check – when he’s done it? Karolina. Gerri’s getting the push.,
What?,
"So we’ll tell her today, swing the legals in, but we can start letting it seep – hang cruises around her neck?",
Clean out the stalls. Strategic refocus. Bit more fucking aggressive!,
"— what this new product offers is community. Safe, secure community, enriched with integrated interactions with the cherished family of Waystar’s movie and TV characters. I’m convinced that the Living Plus real-estate brand can bring the cruise ship experience to dry land, and provide a significant boost to the earnings of our parks division. I couldn’t be more excited—",
That was ‘the thought’?,
