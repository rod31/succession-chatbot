"I’ll be back by Sunday night so I’ll look at his speech with him then, okay? WASHINGTON, DC. 9:15 A.M.",
By the ‘prekend’? What the fuck’s the prekend?,
If he wants them by Friday can he not say Friday?,
Fine. Get Rennie to put them together. Okay?,
"I don’t know, my dad doesn’t really like – things.",
"Not really, no.",
A pen.,
"Yeah, you know, still burying the bodies and counting the cash.",
You smell good. What is that? Date Rape by Calvin Klein?,
‘You wish’?,
Uh-huh. Yup.,
‘Craig’? It’s Greg. No?,
Hey. Big day. Congratulations. You bastard.,
Okay!?,
"Are you getting played, Ken?",
"So, I brought you this. Happy birthday.",
That’s Vancouver?,
"That’s our old house, Dad. These are all our old houses? LA, yeah? Montreal. London?",
Yeah. You like it?,
Perfect.,
Oooh a speech!,
Money.,
Whoa? Okay?,
"What, which would give her, double voting weight?",
"This looks— I mean, yeah. But, I might need to talk to— You know, for all the implications?",
Just to get the full picture?,
As in?,
Oh come on! Ken. This is typical.,
Con!,
"No, absolutely fantastic. The whole day. So thoughtful.",
Fuck you.,
"Can we go? What’s going on, Colin?",
"Yep, sure. I’m not totally against Marcia as a concept. And you know Tom would love to oversee the parks? He’d be good?",
"Dad, I’m not just playing with the politics.",
"My guy, he’s got that Airforce One look.|| So to come back, I’d want the top job.",
"What, me Tom’s boss?",
What’s the long-lost cousin sniffing around for?,
Are you gonna sprinkle some sugar in his bowl?,
You like him?,
My lawyer says it needs to be simple majority.,
"Well – starting position is – I’m diluting my power and that’s, probably a no, right?",
"Well – no, I said— That’s my  position.",
It depends.,
What the final situation is?,
Yeah?? You’ll stick the bottle brush up the Lion King’s butthole?,
He’ll put a kebab skewer through your eyeball.,
Under you?,
Interesting.,
Rome?,
Rome?,
Our position is that this doesn’t quite work for us. At present.,
We get that. We do. We’d like to help. I’d love to help.,
But – why would I? When— I mean— Giving  power. Why would I do that? —,
Dad? Dad.,
Dad? Are you—?,
Why aren’t we moving? Why the fuck aren’t we moving?,
Yeah. No. Yeah.,
No.,
"Um, tell Sarah to get Dad’s doctor. And research the best neurologists.",
"Maybe I should? I should go through my diary with her, clear it out, and you won’t know what’s important …",
What were you and Marcia saying?,
You were just – you were looking at me and talking?,
Should the kids see this?,
Nobody said he was dying.,
No. What? There’s a million people to call. And she’ll make it about her.,
‘Hundred of thousands of …’,
We were just talking.,
"I wasn’t hardballing him, we were talking. A brain hemorrhage doesn’t come from some chit-chat?",
Did they? Or stroke?,
"We already called Doctor Judith. We dropped that we know half the board. Kendall, I’m on it. We are checking out names. We all are trying to do the best. Back the fuck off.",
Do you have cash?,
Well it’s the name I have. Tell her to call them. —,
Ugh. Here? Why would he do that?,
"Yeah? You’re thinking that? What? Will she put all her inheritance into gold, or oil?",
He’s dead. Or brain dead.,
"And if he dies? We’ve signed over to Marcia, basically, the power to choose the new Dad.",
"‘For the record’? What is this, McCarthyism? I’m not declining. I’m just not – clining.",
What circumstances?,
Easy. Yeah?,
"Marcia, we can get the housekeeper, or the driver or Colin to—",
What are people saying?,
"Well, no.",
"Let’s not— We’re waiting for the results of the scan, so it’s a pointless conversation.",
"I can’t talk about it, I’m upset.",
Not too upset to go and fucking plot with the suits?,
"Isn’t there a plan anyway, why do we even need to (talk about this)?",
Well I’m not sure—,
We’re not doing this. If Dad dies I do not want to be talking about this shit when he dies.,
Apparently I need to get a briefing. Sarah? What’s going on?,
"Sure, come on in.",
"Sorry, Tom, could you give us a minute? So?",
Joyce’s husband?,
Oh what the fuck now?,
Delightful. Was he on it?,
Oh great. . Of course it is.,
I’ll do it.,
"So, what? Do you operate?",
Well you can’t do nothing.,
"That’s not good enough, right, Doctor Judith?",
Well thanks for your input but you’ll understand if we check our options – my assistant’s spoken to Ann Wieman at NYU and we might move Dad there.,
"Well, we can discuss. We’ll discuss and get back to you.",
What?,
I’m not doing anything without my lawyer.,
"Greg, did you find the contracts Roman asked for?",
I think you have the wrong ones.,
That’s possible. So—,
"Look, there’s a lot of confusion. Cuz, if you have any doubt, maybe you can’t find them and that might be simplest?",
Don’t bring them.,
"No, I’m just telling you – don’t bring them in.",
What?,
It’s okay?,
"It’s fine, just tell me.",
"If I won’t want to see it, I need to see it.  –  Is that— What …? Is that … an asshole?",
"No. I can’t— No. I’m not contactable tonight, okay? No.",
"Look, hey, let’s not throw our shit around. We’re in the middle. This is why we just hold tight, no sudden moves.",
"But no one knows how serious it is, so we don’t have to say anything.",
"Karolina, has a CEO ever been out of action and people haven’t been told?",
"But can we drag our feet on this, till we figure out the moves?",
"But I don’t know what we know! It’s unclear. It could be flu, it could be an allergic reaction?",
"But if we wanted to say – something, other than what is …",
It’s been a tough day for Ken.,
"And I don’t want to talk about this now but the fact is, if he becomes Acting CEO, he’ll end up CEO.",
And maybe we’re happy? It’s just a question of who would Dad want to be in charge—?,
"I tell you what he really  need, is Dad waking up and going apeshit at him for trying to seize the company while he was unconscious?",
"I guess, and I don’t want to get into this, but I think we need to just cut off the whole Kendall CEO thing. Because otherwise it could get painful?",
It won’t be you.,
Come on?,
Yes you do.,
Sure. Anyone. Tom? Karl?,
Cunt. Frank?,
I mean it could be anyone. It’s only temporary?,
"I don’t love Gerri, I don’t even like Gerri, but I don’t hate Gerri.",
Is it definitely his?,
Is an asshole like a fingerprint?,
Can we find out if an asshole has—?,
Is every asshole unique?,
"Thanks, guys! Someone fell asleep in asshole class … Can we chase that?",
Was the account in Daniel’s name?,
"Who’s the friend, what’s their name, why, when, how, where’s the card, it’d last like, three to five hours?",
‘He’s such a dick he couldn’t even snap his own dick’? I don’t know if that helps …,
Don’t we own him? ‘Shit Show at the Fuck Factory’?,
"Fuck them. When Jobs was croaking, Apple didn’t say anything.",
"Fuck off, Kendall. Don’t talk to Tom like that.",
"You were  announced, but then you weren’t, Ken. Look, I hate to say this but the only thing we know for certain, for absolute certain, is Dad didn’t want you to be boss. So if there was a list of the seven billion people on earth, you’re one of the very few people we’d know for sure Dad did not want running this company.",
"I think you do. Without it, after what Dad did to you, we could take any appointment to court.",
"Hey, I didn’t want to talk about this, remember?!",
Nothing.,
"What, do you want me to actually say?",
"You lack killer instinct, you’re wet, you’re green, you’re intellectually insecure—",
"You’re not emotionally strong enough, you have addiction issues—",
I don’t think all that. I’m just trying to be Dad’s voice—,
"Thanks, baby. No way.",
But we have options.,
I can’t believe my dad’s dying and I’m having to deal with this asshole’s asshole.,
"Joyce, I’m so sorry he cheated on you. You deserve better.",
Oh? Okay. But – it was his credit card? And his laptop?,
Right? And did he report it?,
Joyce? What? If this comes out we’re just saying it wasn’t him?,
"It’s okay. We – we— Look, let’s cool this off. Have you talked to him?",
"That’s not my area, Joyce.",
We’re weeks out from a Senate Primary.,
And you said?,
Snake.,
Well I’m saying no.,
Gerri’s been with the company for twenty years. Dad trusts her.,
"And so in my opinion we should find someone else, temporary.",
"Someone neutral, anyone. Eva. What’s he called, American Psycho? Or Karl?",
Fuck you.,
"Tom, I’m not in the mood for fucking around—",
Are you serious?,
What is it about my dad dying in a – a – sterile environment that screams ‘big romantic gesture’ to you?,
"Tom, you can’t balance it out like that? I’m not gonna give you a – blowjob when your dog dies, yeah?",
"No, I’m sorry. It’s fine. Look. Why don’t you do this again properly another time. Yeah? Let’s not have this as the moment?",
Good.,
"But so you know, sure, whatever.",
"Sure. When it happens, yes. Such a shit show.",
My family.,
"While Dad is ill, the family proposes that Kendall should run the company, with Roman as COO.",
"Good luck. I have to say for the record, I personally believe this to be a total fucking disaster.",
"Stay strong, Dad. Keep fighting.",
Have you looked at the numbers? Poor Ken. He’s like dysentery for the stock price. You’re walking into a burning barn.,
Weird.,
"Tom, listen, will you come with me?",
Tell them you went to see the big boss. Please? C’mon.,
Hey ‘she’s’ here!,
Is everything okay?,
"Likewise. Look, I know you said he wasn’t great, but I was passing and I just thought, why not (drop by)?",
"Sure, but I just thought I’d pop up even if he’s grumpy—?",
"It’s okay, I’ll take the earbashing!",
Hi? Shiv. Logan’s daughter? Thanks so much for everything by the way.,
"Yeah well, much appreciated.",
I can’t fucking believe it. Can you? Fucking – where does she get off?,
"I’ll be two minutes, thanks.",
"It’s got weird, okay? I was over there and it’s gotten very weird.",
"I don’t know, he might have put on a sock.",
"Or he might be lying there dead, I have no idea.",
"I do not. Apparently, he doesn’t want to see us.",
Why would he say that?,
Well maybe . Look did  see him over the weekend?,
No one’s seen him since we moved him home from the hospital on like Thursday?,
But after that? No one apart from Marcia has seen him for the better part of a week.,
"Okay for the majority of the week. And we’re just accepting, the world is just accepting, this woman’s word that he put on a fucking sock?",
"Right, cos you like playing boss? Ken, we need to know what’s going on. Will you go over and see, please?",
Okay. Everything okay?,
Hey Daniel. I understand you wanted to talk to me direct?,
"Well, let’s get right to it, shall we? What happened? What do we say?",
"Uh-huh. Fine. But between us, I don’t have time for a lot of – tofu. Was it your asshole online, were you looking to fuck around, what’s going on?",
"Yeah but we’re not public and if this hack leaks Joyce is going to get fucked at a thousand miles an hour from every direction, so I need the facts?",
"‘Everything isn’t as it seems’? That’s what I’m building my house on? What is that, your fucking Vegas magic show?",
"Okay well that’s a huge waste of my time, and I can’t speak for your wife but that’s a fucking treehouse of dildos right at the heart of this operation, so thanks a million and goodnight.",
Hey. Nathaniel.,
Busy.,
It’s work.,
What?!,
It’s just private is all. The matter in hand.,
Good. How about you with that poor man’s Fidel Castro? The senior senator from the state of 1975.,
Look. I just wondered if you could do me a favor?,
Sure. Because I deigned to date you?,
And I thought we were going to be friends?,
I wondered if you could run a background check on someone?,
It’s not political.,
I need background on someone off the record. Marcia.,
"Occurred to me a few years too late, I really don’t know much about her. Just due diligence. Okay?",
"Well, thank you. That sounds perfect. Can it all go through you?",
No need to tell Ken.,
You don’t need to know—,
"First husband, you remember – Lebanese businessman. They had the high life in Paris, lot of parties, lot of pols and writers and also lot of slimeballs and fixers and shitbags and arms dealers. Oil guys—",
Further back is complicated. No leads.,
"It is apparently a little weird and there are two possibilities. Either, she came from kind of nowhere, Tripoli, Lebanon, turns up in Paris as a publishing assistant aged thirty-one and marries this guy, fine—",
"A clean-up job. Someone sometime tidied loose ends, did a deep- clean, bleached Google. Tied everything off.",
"Yeah, hi. You know Connor, Logan’s firstborn son.",
"And this is Tom, my, partner. And between them they are over twelve feet of we would like to see him please?",
Is this about me signing some pieces of paper or—,
"Oh, the fucking waterworks now is it?",
I can’t believe you would try to stop me seeing my father!,
"Dad—? How are you feeling? So, I wanted to come in. Um. Tom and I are engaged and—?",
The … You mean the dog?,
Uh-huh. Thank you. He’s looking better.,
Uh-huh. Sure. He wasn’t himself.,
Yes?,
Right?,
"So, I’m going to speak to Connor to confirm table arrangements? We’re hosting basically the same table as last year plus Joyce and Daniel, that okay?",
Yeah you did. Remember? Racist Belgian GS guy and his wife who tried to kill herself?,
Yeah?,
Uh-huh?,
Ugh. Fuck.,
What is this?,
What? Fuck off. Can you prove that? How will you prove that? Do assholes have fingerprints?,
Has everyone got it?,
"Okay, well, bring it on.",
They’re not going to run with it?,
"It’s not even a story, Roman. Her ? That’s— It’s unfair.",
"Days from a special election? I mean, we’re ahead but this could – this could have an effect.",
"Okay, well thanks for the heads-up and fuck you very much.",
And she’s coming through the service entrance.,
"Can you write it down? I’m sorry, it’s a crisis day.",
"Right and I don’t know if she’s bringing Daniel or— That seat’s in limbo. That’s a limbo seat, okay? I’ll confirm closer to the time.",
"Listen, thanks for jumping on this whole thing. With Marcia busy with Dad.",
Fuck.,
You’ve seen the annotated transcript?,
Hey!,
"So, we need to issue a statement and as planned just move the conversation back to your issues.",
This is just for background.,
A straight finger – a hetero finger?,
Nothing else?,
"Anything else? In terms of what went up there? Any surprises? Because first it’s a finger, then it’s a fist, then it’s a dildo shaped like Richard Nixon?",
"Agreed. But for us, now, this isn’t going away. I think you need to talk to your husband.",
"So. Look, I want you to call off your dogs.",
Because this obsession with Joyce – it’s out of line. It’s sitting very high in your half-hour.,
And it’s vindictive and it’s – it’s actually it’s bad for democracy.,
So? Are you going to respond?,
Are you running this because you think my dad likes this shit?,
"Look. Okay. We are where we are. If I could get you some nasty little tidbits on other folks I know, could you ramp this down?",
"But you’re leading it, Eva. You had a ten-minute sexpert segment on how to keep your man happy in bed, on a ?",
"No. I’m saying, as her strategist, this level of attack starts to reflect on your professional judgment and you should think about the future because this is the old world and things will change – in the world, one day.",
"Well, I’m very grateful.",
Uh-huh.,
As in—?,
Uh-huh?,
And what’s the right thing?,
Sounds brave.,
"Yeah. Look, I know it feels huge to us but it started the day as item three, end of day, I think it will be item five.",
"I can’t stop it. Your husband’s asshole is the gift that just keeps on shitting. We just have to hunker down, keep focussed, ride the cycle.",
I don’t think that’s a good play.,
It’s me saying that.,
"Well – definite end, just as a fact, to kill this for now and ‘the future’ is if you leave him?",
"But I can’t advise on that? So, see you – both – later?",
"Nice one, bro.",
Fucking the talent?,
"ATN are fucking me, you’re fucking ATN. It’s a literal fucking clusterfuck.",
Yeah nor me.,
"It’s not a competition, Tom. I was up till three-forty, actually, writing pros and cons of sticking with Joyce, on her PAC, and you were snoring like a hog. So?",
The prenup.,
Yeah?,
That’s a very romantic way of looking at a prenup.,
"You have to look at it, Tom.",
I don’t want you to . That’s not the basis for a healthy relationship.,
Is there a problem?,
What is it?,
You mean your mom says?,
"Sure, so what did your mom say?",
What?,
"Fine. We’ll change it. Guess I just got Wambsganned, huh?",
I tell you what is unconscionable. Cranberry sauce in a can.,
"Yes, my mom and dad’s divorce was horrible. I just don’t want more … mess.",
"Uh-huh? You write a will, don’t you? Even though you’re not expecting to die?",
Do you think she charges overtime for holidays?,
"Joyce? She won, Grace. She’s a US senator.",
I’m pretty sure. I was there. I was up for seventy-two hours. It was kind of a big deal for me? I’ve been asked to be senior advisor.,
Thanks.,
Oh really. And why’s that?,
"Uh-huh. That’s, interesting. I mean too fake  too real?",
"Yeah, I mean, not usually from family on Thanksgiving …",
"You don’t think she has a sort of, presidential quality?",
And how do you do that? Pray tell?,
I must write down this recipe.,
Yeah yeah yeah.,
This is no way our worst Thanksgiving.,
You mean your mom.,
Yeah we don’t need to do that.,
Right. And if it does. You know. We’re both grown-ups.,
"I don’t know. Nothing’s going to happen. But, things happen. We both travel.",
"Yeah, well, anyway, point is – shit happens.",
"No. Not to us. No. But yes shit happens. That’s why we have the expression, ‘Shit happens’. Tom. I have not cheated on you. Because I love you.",
Yeah I guess I am thankful for that. And I’m thankful for this delicious food.,
A potato.,
Don’t mention that in front of Roman!,
I don’t think Dad meant it?,
"But Amir. That’s hard, it must have been nice for you him being down at Wharton? Tough on you him going to Europe.",
"Uh-huh. Still, at least you’ve got some skin in the game now, ah?",
You know what. I don’t think I can do it?,
Joyce’s PAC. I just don’t think she’s the one. I’m not sure I can take her all the way?,
You were never sure? Then why the fuck didn’t you say anything?,
"This bed isn’t a king is it? We need to get a bigger bed. It’s so airless in here, I can hardly breathe.",
Could you move over? That’s too close.,
Uh-huh? This the thing I don’t want to know about?,
And you can trust Greg?,
I don’t know. Ugh. I just I – I don’t fucking know! Do I stick with her? Is that a president?,
"I know one thing: people don’t change. Candidates don’t change. You plump and primp and re-present but if you think you’re going to change them, fundamentally? Forget it.",
"Uh-huh, um, on that I kind of had a shitty call with my mom? And to smooth things, I said we might go to England, for the wedding.",
Yeah. Is that a biggie for you?,
Tom. It’s just the wedding. The planners will figure it out.,
"Tom. I can’t do this right now. Okay? I’m thinking about work. I’m looking forward to it, I just can’t get into it all. And it might need to be in England but maybe not. Okay?",
Hey hey hey!,
No worries.,
Um. Yeah. I don’t know. I mean we’ve changed. Everything changes.,
Yeah. Well. I do have feelings.,
Thank you.,
"Fuck you, you’ve seen the numbers.",
I did a fucking good job. In the teeth of a scandal. This point in the cycle? I knocked it out of the fucking park. So here’s to me. Thank you. How’s everything in the People’s Republic of Gil Eavis?,
Okay. Well I want you to think about joining us. Me and Joyce—,
I need a piece of shit on the team. Like a real amoral fucking knifeman.,
"The team I’m assembling. We’re good on strategy, but in terms of rat- fucking and oppo-research, shit-stirring, muck-raking. We need a bit of edge. I’m just being honest. We can be honest, right?",
"This is long-term planning. You know? For now, it’s the PAC. But I’ll maneuver her chief of staff out, take the top job, we go White House. I’ll run things, you could take a nice role. What do you think?",
Why?,
We’re grown-ups.,
"Ooh, it’s exciting when you know more about me than I do!",
Right. You know I am actually a considerably more successful political strategist than you?,
I’ve been grooming Joyce for three years.,
Exactly.,
What a horrible thing to say.,
Tom’s a great guy.,
You’re such a fucking prick.,
"I tried playing with you, you broke.",
Gil’s a strong flavor.,
And what does an amoral mercenary like you see in him?,
Oooooh.,
Tom. He’s amazing. He’s great.,
It is great.,
But he is great.,
"We’re not going to fuck tonight, right?",
Really? Car model or failed actress?,
I’m kidding of course. That’s nice.,
I’m getting married in March.,
"Well, it’s not a competition.",
"Oh no, come on, Nate.",
"Right, ‘Romeo, Romeo, why don’t you come up here and stick it in?’ A French doctor? She sounds too nice and interesting for you.",
I think this is nice. This is like being friends right?,
"Nate, but shall we be good people?",
"Would that be nice? To wake up tomorrow and be like, phew, maybe I’m not a piece of shit?",
You could stay here? We could try?,
It would be the single greatest feat of fortitude in the history of human existence.,
They’d build statues of us.,
I guess.,
We were good. We were really good.,
Hey!,
"What happened, are you sick?",
Did someone poison you? With booze? I got you something. I missed you.,
"Yeah well, sorry for missing you. What – the fuck?",
Well more – tell me more.,
"Kendall, call me! Did you know?",
Kendall did? Well who the fuck else knew about this?!,
Not a single one of them involved me. It’s complete bullshit.,
What was that? Are you on a horse?,
You knew?,
Not hard enough. Fuck. He’s fired half the board.,
"Fired. Frank. Asha. Fired. The rebels are getting shot in the town square. I’ll talk to you later, Tom.",
You fired Kendall?,
All your children?,
Dad? I didn’t know.,
"Pop. Perspective. We all need to calm down, okay, you don’t want a huge incident here. Kendall only acted this way because you took back what you promised him?",
All the class-war shit? Don’t you find it a little jejune?,
It means—,
Okay so is this you pulling my hair? Cos why are you even bringing me in? I’m not a good fit.,
That’s as far as she’ll go.,
New Mexico? And  wouldn’t be an issue?,
The – atmosphere?,
Right?,
I thought you were marrying a French doctor?,
Holy fuck. No way!,
I’m not. But what the fuck?,
Not Kendall?,
Bullshit. What’s he doing? Do you think he’s going to kill us one by one like in an Agatha Christie novel?,
Thank you. I’m a hero. Can you imagine: Connor? Dad? Roman?  It’ll be like tossing a bag of Uzis into the soft-play area.,
"Just do what you feel is right, Tom.",
I get it. You’re your own guy. It’s fine. I won’t judge.,
"Ooh, and it’s possible I will be breaking out to make a meeting with Gil? He might have a window.",
Fuck? Google alert on Ken …,
No!,
This is—,
"Whatever, hey, I’m not in charge of you. Go get us some drinks!",
How would I know?,
Yeah fuck you.,
You know Dad’s gonna try to ‘win’ at therapy.,
My guy says if he’d had therapy I wouldn’t need it.,
I’m not sure you actually did make it through?,
What photographs? Did you know this?,
"No way, now?",
"I can’t now, Nate. The whole reason I came out here is to do this, family thing. Can we schedule tomorrow?",
I just can’t right now.,
Shit.,
Good to have that clear.,
Sure. No. Agreed.,
I’m just processing. But yeah.,
"Dad, you can’t just do one sentence.",
"Look where I’m at is I’m having a hard time diving in because – I guess honestly, I wonder why did he bring us here? I mean was it for this photo opportunity?",
"Excuse me, there’s an interview now?",
No you didn’t. What? So this is a publicity event essentially?,
"This is not okay. I have a publicist for this stuff. Con, did you know?",
Rome?,
"That’s not a feeling, Dad.",
I turned down something huge to be here and now you’re just going to tank it?,
Look. What I think we should actually have a conversation about is the fact that Kendall’s not here. And that’s because there are reports all over that Kendall’s taking drugs. And I for one don’t know where those have come from.,
What does that mean?,
I don’t think there really is a remit?,
Well.,
Honestly no. I think this is all fake.,
"Listen, I’m going to Santa Fe to meet Gil.",
"Yes, we solved everything. Done. Totally sane. I won’t be more than a few hours, will you be okay?",
Can I take a car?,
The Tesla. I have a meeting in town. I’m not taking this seriously when no one else is.,
"You’re sweet and I love you, but you’re dreaming.",
Doesn’t even trust water.,
"Nate, Ronnie Reagan taught me how to gallop. I’m not going to turn green and do a shit when I meet Gil Eavis. This is just a fuckload of press?",
So naive.,
Gil Eavis. Stalin in a sweater.,
"Really? Um. Well, my family’s fucked. I’m hardly talking to my dad and my brother’s suing my dad.",
"And, how are you? Are you gonna go for it?",
And – what – are you thinking I can help handle the message on that?,
I think you’re too radical.,
So this is a job offer?,
My name?,
Well that section has nowhere else to go. So fuck ’em.,
Ooo. Lah-di-dah!,
I can’t help with that.,
And how do you know I won’t betray you?,
I can work with Nate. I can’t work for Nate. It’s fine. It’s just a preposition thing.,
He’s good.,
I don’t know. Okay.,
Turn it off.,
Oh … Hey?,
Yeah. So what happened with the whole – fake therapy? Any pretend breakthroughs? Any good performances?,
I was meeting about a prospective job.,
"Okay, I’m going to bed.",
"What is that supposed to mean? I had a meeting! You do what the hell like on everything, forever.",
"Jesus, Kendall.",
"It’s my work, if anyone, Jesus you should—",
"Oh, of course, it’s about you? What if I actually believe in his points about the purchases, or just his whole philosophy … ?",
Disagreeing with Dad is not treason!,
"You are beyond, you are …",
I’m sorry.,
I’m so sorry.,
You saw this?,
You’re going to stand right there? In my air space?,
You’re cc’d.,
I can’t believe I get paid to call my dad names. It’s so cathartic.,
"Sure. Into the lion’s den. He attacks them, righteous, Old Testament anti-capitalist Gil. They attack us, ‘there’s a red in the bed!’ No one’s mind’s getting changed. We get the base fired up. They get the viewers. Then, once we’re through the primaries, we pivot to center.",
"Pretty sure you’re not supposed to be telling me this, Tom?",
Tom. We’re adults. It’s one night. Enjoy yourself.,
"I love you too, Tom.",
Uh-huh.,
"My philosophy is I literally don’t give a fuck. So what’s that, Nietzsche?",
You want us to have matching cutlery?,
"Right what and then when we get divorced and split all the stuff, we can hook up and still have the full set?",
"You know this is just fun, right?",
"Nothing. I mean there’s no God, and there’s no – anything. So there’s just people, trying to be happy, in rooms. Right?",
"And you know I’m suggesting to Gil, on ATN, he cools off on the anti-Waystar agenda.",
I talked to him after the thing.,
It’s played out. It looks like we have an agenda.,
"Uh-huh? Even if we’re going for that, isn’t it in a big important speech nobody reads? Tonight he can forget the base and connect with America.",
Fuck you. I just want him to win.,
"Tom, sweetheart, listen, I’m at ATN with Gil, what is the least number of syllables you think you can say this in?",
"What are you talking about, Tom?",
Um. I don’t know if—,
"Tom. I can’t negotiate right now. Just— We know, right? We know.",
You want to run the tree on how personal stuff plays?,
The warmest of ATN welcomes.,
Doesn’t he have a line for this?,
No. No jokes. Nate?,
I don’t— It doesn’t feel great? I’m going hot and cold so fast I think I might have hit the fucking menopause.,
Oh fuck.,
Then you should puke. We could use the distraction.,
Well. Family. How was the play?,
Very exciting.,
You saw the interview?,
You came after the man’s wife.,
And you’re happy with that?,
So – silence the man who says you’re stifling dissent?,
What if your acquisitions are bad for the country?,
The fucking wedding? I don’t care about—,
So that’s why you tried Kendall and Roman first? You know what – I am the smartest. Which is why I can see through you and this transparent little offer to buy me off.,
Like what?,
"Okay. You know what, Dad? If this is the way things are going—",
Can I stay? But – with you – just as a human dog at the foot of the bed?,
Tom …?,
Is everything okay?,
Oh. This is new.,
"You know what? I don’t care if you use my name— but the truth is, you don’t need to. He’s scared of us.",
Oh. You’re back already? I was just—,
How was it?,
So what happened?,
"Specifically what, Tom?",
"I’m shitting you, Tom. It’s good to have you back.",
"So, Tom? Listen, you know the toxic thing that you know about that I told you I didn’t want to know about?",
"I think, one way and another, I’m ready to know about it now.",
"Listen, I’m going to have to go. I’ll see you there, you’ve got the change from Sarah about the time for the embassy— Sorry, are we okay?",
"You don’t have to come down to the wedding, Gil, if you’re busy?",
The – the – the bit—,
"Gil, let us hit that, you need to—",
I really don’t think it’s good to focus on—,
Well – it’s complicated—,
I’m not sure that’s wise.,
"In the end, I’ll do whatever you want, Gil.",
"We don’t need to rehearse, we’re gonna kill it.",
Fuck him.,
"Look, I know this is kind of weird timing, but there’s something I need to ask … to clear up.",
"I could do with knowing about the bad thing, in cruises, you know the thing that meant you couldn’t sleep?",
No?,
"Right but you always wanted to make it public, didn’t you?",
Exactly.,
"I guess, if it’s bad, the longer you leave it the worse it will be when it comes out?",
I bet it’s not even that bad!,
How about you just tell me? Then I’ll be in a good position to judge what you should do with the information?,
"Oh fuck, here we go.",
Hey. Did you talk to the Wicked Witch of the North yet?,
"Shall we? Oh fuck. Saddle up, soldier!",
"Hi, hi, Mom.",
Thank you.,
Mom?,
"No worries, my travel agent specializes in guilt trips.",
Excuse me?,
No. Absolutely not.,
Dad. And Marcia.,
"No, I don’t want him to. He never apologized. But Marcia called Tom —",
Meanwhile Marcia called Charlotte and said they were on the jet.,
I don’t know? Maybe I have security – just fucking stop him?,
"If he’s got the balls to walk in, what do we do? Set the dogs on him? No seat, let him stand?",
"Mom, c’mon?",
Marcia?,
We actually became quite close. During Dad’s illness.,
Delicious!,
Protein. I’m not a fucking hen to lay you eggs? I’m a strategist.,
Plans changed. I was ambushed. I’m sorry.,
Well I didn’t realize it was such a chore?,
"Look, there’s no press. No pictures. We have jammers and a fucking, hawk to take out drones. It’ll be like it never happened?",
Maybe. I think so. Just not yet.,
"Yeah, sure, I’m just concerned. About collateral damage – Tom?",
Says the man who has no idea what he’s even talking about.,
"Oh we don’t talk about that, it would be a conflict of interest.",
"Great to meet you, I’ve heard so little about you!",
"Oh no. No I think – it was her uncle’s, her great-uncle’s, or— The story gets mangled. There was an uncle, who ended up living in Gibraltar with a monkey, and I don’t know. He swindled my mom’s grandpa or. I don’t know. My mom— We’d always come and stay with her nearby. She lives near, to keep the wound fresh, you know?",
Right. So what do you do? Who ?,
Yeah?,
"Okay well, I’m going to split because I can see my husband-to-be talking to my ex and it’s making feel like I’m going to hurl, good?",
Okay?,
And have you thought any more about if you want to tell me about the secret thing which—?,
You met Nate before I think?,
"No? Okay. Well, he’s a good colleague and Kendall and him ran around in Shanghai. And he’s a dick. I mean he’s okay. But he has a certain dickish quality as well. I told you about him?",
What do you mean?,
"All the people are here, Tom.",
"And plus I do, I do want to.",
Tom?,
"As soon as two colleagues are close, Tom? DC loves gossip.",
Honestly? This is real. I’m not fucking around.,
Good. Thank you.,
You’re a good guy. When I met you I was I was a fucking mess. I need you.,
Uh-huh. Same old same old.,
Still?,
And have you personally got plausible deniability?,
Greg?,
What – you’d – kill – Greg?,
Right.,
You’re a good guy.,
And I love you.,
Hey!,
Nate.,
"Um, nope. Not yet, no joy.",
Hey.,
Great. You weren’t actually invited though? Maybe I’ll see if they can make you an omelette or something? Find you a chair?,
"Oh I didn’t realize  contributed, Marcia, I’m so rude. Thank you.",
"Um, Mom?",
"Mom, I hear you’re asking people, ‘How long do you give it?’",
Yeah. Sure. But it’s kind of horrible?,
Well could you ask them about the price of fucking fish instead?,
Uh-huh. Thank you.,
"She’s being a stone-cold bitch. Listen. Last meet, tonight, if you want? In The Place? I need to catch Dad.",
"Sleep well, Dad. Marcia.",
Could be your last good one for a decade or two?,
The cruise situation?,
"Uh-huh. Sure. Well, you might be about to find out? Unless?",
"You don’t know, Marcia. Okay?",
"Maybe, maybe you do.",
Excuse me?,
"Who  you? Apart from a, a fucking, machine for, accumulating power and keeping yourself – safe.",
Never to do a single thing for its own sake. Have you ever had a fucking – grapefruit – without an agenda?,
Hey hey. Gerri. Thanks for—,
Just a chat?,
"Okay, look, it’s late, so. Here’s the situation. I know all about the cruise-division horror show. And the cover-up. And Gil wants to go to town on you. But maybe I can stop him. If ATN lays off the personal stuff. Gil’s wife.",
No. Keep attacking him through the primaries. Fire up our base. Then back off for the general. But no more wife stuff.,
Sure they are. I just feel confident a little public comment or two from my dad. An email. The minions realign pretty quick?,
"Yes, I’m bullying. I’m blackmailing you. I’m threatening to destroy my father. However you want to put it.",
Oh come on. It is what it is.,
"And Tom needs to be clean, move him on. Move him up. Maybe abroad. Clean hands.",
"Thank you, fairy godmother.",
I think I can persuade him that a dirty LBJ gets more done than a clean McGovern. Okay. Goodnight. No marriage advice from my dear old godmother?,
Hey. ROMAN KENDALL Hey!,
Where’s Con?,
"Oh, man! What?",
It’s nothing. I just thought it would be nice. But I don’t— Um? I have things to do. You know?,
To old times.,
Yeah. I’m sorry. I don’t know why I got you down here.,
It is what it is.,
Are you serious?,
"Fuck you, come on then.",
Roman?,
"Here we all are, happy as can be, all good friends and jolly good company.",
Oh sure.,
I like your date.,
I’ve never done crack. But I guess Mom is like how I imagine crack?,
If crack didn’t get you high. You’re jonesing. Then you get a hit. And …  come-down.,
"Um, okay? I’m not sure …",
"Connor, she’s been a call girl and one day that might come out and it could hurt my profile, or Tom’s profile, so I don’t want to be horrible but, you get it, okay?",
Okay?,
"Good because, Gil, will be – eager, to keep things discreet.",
"No. Phallocentric bullshit. I don’t want a big fucking – dick blasting off at my wedding, okay?",
You okay?,
Con?,
"He’s going to be president, Con.",
Roman. It would just be fucking weird. Don’t be a little kid.,
"Oh come on, man.",
One of who?,
"Yeah well sorry if I don’t want to come to your freewheelin’, good- time, n-word-shouting hoedown.",
"Wait, have you been watching our channels? I thought you knew not to do that, with your IQ?",
"Okay. Who wants to hear about the bachelorette party? Well, unlucky. Because there’s nothing to tell. We ate chocolates and watched romcoms while sewing. And no one will tell you different. Because we killed the strippergram. No but seriously. I want to thank my dad. We’ve had the occasional little difference but I’m happy to say we see eye to eye on most things. I’d also like to thank my brothers but they’ve basically been a pain in the ass my whole life so I’m not going to. No, I’m grateful to them being here, especially given how busy they are. Roman had to launch a rocket today. And Kendall’s spinning a million plates. And Connor is basically an older Bruce Wayne, who knows what that enigmatic man is really up to. I wouldn’t be who I am without having them as role models showing me so clearly what not to do. And I’d like to thank Tom. For being my rock. You’re a good guy, Wambsgans, and I like hanging out with ya.",
Thanks for the text message. What the fuck was that? ‘I won’t do it if you don’t.’ Is that a kind of anti-proposal?,
What’s happened with what?,
"Oh, okay, that’s an interesting change of perspective?",
I’m going to make him win.,
I might not agree.,
"‘Inequality.’ If you can’t handle it, fuck off.",
I’m Shiv fucking Roy. And I’m going to have two grateful people: the president and my father.,
So what the fuck? Dad told us. How could you?,
I think we get to talk to you any way we fucking like.,
"This is a unilateral decision. To fundamentally alter the nature of the family, on my wedding day. Do you have any conception of how fucking selfish you are?",
Fuck off.,
"Look, I’m no fucking blushing bride – but the, the lack of thought, I can’t believe it. To do this to Dad, today?",
"So, do you wanna talk about the takeover, and how it affects—",
Because I mean you’re in on merit and if he succeeds I think it will be tough but in terms of—,
I mean if Gil takes off I think – well – maybe I don’t even want to go back inside and our five-year plan looks a little different?,
I have bad news about my hymen.,
Sheep farmers?,
Yes?,
"I should say something, Tom. I should have said. But I’ve had a little number?",
"And I think we both agreed we were grown-ups. I mean I think we had an unspoken agreement, that we were—",
"I think I always implied, you know?",
"And if I’ve hurt you, and I’ve got it wrong, I’m so fucking sorry.",
"But I think, from this point on, I want everything to be really open and honest.",
"Sure. Although, what if people ask why he’s being sent home?",
Tom. I just think – I’m not sure. I’m not sure I’m a good fit for a monogamous marriage.,
Yeah?,
Is that okay? Is that okay to say to you?,
"Yeah, maybe that would have been wise.",
"I just think, you know, I needed you, very much, I was not in good shape when we hooked up and I think the business angle, works, we know that. We have a plan on that.",
"But in terms of the relationship. Is there an opportunity for something different from the – whole, box-set death-march? A different shape of relationship? Could that be exciting?",
Right? It’s exciting?,
"We’ve pulled everything else down. But love’s the last one, it’s the last fridge magnet left.",
"I mean ‘love’ is about twenty-eight different things – it’s a lumpy sack. And it needs to get emptied out because there’s a lot of ugly products in that Santa sack. Fear and jealousy and control and revenge – and they get such a pretty fucking wrapping in that stocking, it looks so nice, but you open it up—",
"So, what’s he been saying?",
Okay?,
Fuck knows. Yeah. I guess?,
"Tom? Easy. I mean, what are you thinking?",
I’m getting a lot of board action. You?,
Frank? I think they need to be on the same page before they talk to the board?,
Ugh. Everyone’s fucking lawyering up!,
"I don’t know. I don’t know, I don’t fucking know!! Jesus. What a fucking disaster!",
Who’s that?,
Urgh. . That fucking little insider-trading kiddie-fiddler?,
What am I thinking?,
As in—? In terms of? What?,
"Well, what are you thinking?",
Fine. Okay. I’ll tell you what I’m thinking. I’m thinking what you’re thinking.,
I’m thinking we just have to back Dad right now and I can’t believe anyone would be thinking anything else?,
"But you mean, what am I  thinking?",
I’m thinking: Is he toast?,
"Well yeah, why, what are you thinking?",
Did he pull it out of an intern’s asshole where he buried it in 1976?,
They look solid. When they’re not shaking like shitting dogs.,
"What, ‘Hey Dad you ever rape anyone?’",
Here’s a suggestion: how about we assume my father isn’t Rape Van Winkle?,
And these papers?,
"I’m afraid Ken’s changed the game. Non-cooperation, now, I think it’s just too hot out there. It’s very high-risk.",
Hey I eat red meat. But the – repercussions?,
I’ll be in touch with the microbes.,
Like he can’t make a private fucking call?,
His fucking welcome mat?,
Uh-huh. I guess. I guess.,
"I need to look after my dad, Tom.",
So we loading up—?,
"We okay, Gerri?",
"Sorry, what the fuck. To ?",
Okay. Fuck. What do all those countries have in common?,
I imagine none of them have an extradition treaty with the US?,
We might be going to Sarajevo.,
I dunno. My gut is cooperate. But my gut isn’t your gut.,
"Um, Lisa? I know her yeah. Yeah, she’s a pretty— She’s a friend.",
Um. I dunno. She loves money and she fucking loves winning. She’s great. I just don’t—,
"Right. So, who, who would …?",
"I want you safe, number one.",
"Right. Sure. Okay. Cos, look, I love you.",
Well obviously I’ll see him again. Why would you even say that?,
Well I know that. Thanks.,
Did Ken call you?,
"Hold on. Let me check that? Okay, what? Interim?",
And what’s the temperature?,
"Oh sure! But listen, do you want it?",
So you’re okay to push me?,
"You can get too fucking clever with this, right?",
"What? Oh. No. No, just bullshit.",
What?,
Oh? Okay.,
"Oh, no, okay. Right. Now you mention it, maybe he did?",
How come Frank told you and how come you told him?,
"So, what have you heard?",
"Hey. Okay. Okay, Dad. Well great thanks. Thank you. Sure I can do it. I can.",
He wants me to get Lisa.,
"Uh-huh. He said, you two just wait airport adjacent – he might need someone, on investors. You might have to go to Boston to see the Ulsterman. Or, you know, hijack a plane and fly him to Cuba?",
"Oh yeah no, he said, it’s me.",
"Hey, Lisa! How you doing, goddess?!",
"How’s things, this place is amazing – how’s everything, how’s —?",
Yeah the message came through. You can’t act for my dad.,
"Okay but, cards on the table. I want to talk to you about something else.",
"Yeah. I’m thinking about my own position. And honestly, I could do with a friend. A discreet friend with legal training. A consigliere. A, a smart savvy woman who can help me navigate the position I find myself in.",
"Look. Honestly, honestly, I just have nowhere to fucking – turn, Lise? My husband is a player in this. One world I could be in a position to come out here as CEO. Or I might have to leave the operation to preserve my reputation. I don’t know what my dad did or my brother did or the firm did and, I’m in a fucking – fuck pie here. Can I clean it up? I don’t know. I have a plan, but I could easily get fucking crushed between these men, and, and I need to game shit out and I need to do that with someone who can give me a read, legally, culturally, politically, socially, because it’s a lot. And I trust you and—",
Oh. Okay. Fuck. Jesus. Okay? Right? Does that mean what I think it means?,
"Okay well. I would just say, think about who you want to hitch your wagon to, honey, because a lot of wagons are going in the ditch.",
"You’d actually consider working with that disingenuous little fuck-doll? Because he’s not on the level, Lisa.",
"Hi. So. Here he is, the little man who started this big war.",
"Look, at you, so fucking – merry. Is Lisa here?",
"Yeah, that’s not why I came here.",
"Look. I’m not here to cozy up. But, for the record, I would say, what Dad asked from you, the sacrifice, was cold.",
Uh-huh?,
"So, I get it, you were angry but that was a fucking snake move, okay? You should have talked to me.",
That was self-aggrandizing bullshit. It was a peacock fuck- show.,
I’m sorry?,
"Oh come on, fuck you.",
That is not it. You fucked the family.,
"You dragged our reputation through the mud, that was Medici shit. That presser is his whole obituary now.",
"You reduced him to a – a – a caricature, of a version, of his worst aspects.",
Oh c’mon!,
Like you give a fuck about any victims.,
Okay. You have a ? Wow. And that’s really sort of clarified your position on sexual assaults? You’re definitely against now? You’re acting out a personal grudge against Dad.,
"On TV? America isn’t your therapist, Ken. It was just so, fucking – unclassy.",
"‘Crime ring’. Look, we are all, since this thing broke, we have all been, I think, trying to chart a way through this, through conflicting loyalties – without getting too binary. And that’s difficult. And if, through some inflexibility of mind, you can’t navigate that, and you have to turn fucking – Jacobin – that’s not my affair.",
"So, look. Where are these famous papers?",
"Uh-huh. You know – lose those, all this goes away. Burn them. Go say sorry to Dad? Beg for mercy?",
Then show me the papers.,
Does he know who’s here?,
"Well, I mean. Um.",
"Uh-huh. We should bring him in, of course.",
"Um, good. Why? What’s going on?",
Me? I’m just taking five. I’m home.,
"Yeah well, just another humiliation. I dunno.",
Will do. And – thanks for checking in. And – Tom. I love you.,
"And – you know, do you—?",
‘Why’?,
"Well because, I guess it seems pretty important if you do or not?",
Okay. Because I do love you.,
Hey.,
How is Dad?,
I’ve had my phone off. No agenda.,
How is he?,
"Well, what’s yours?",
"Oh, sure. .",
‘Fuck you.’,
And I’m just here to get you to back down.,
Why didn’t you come to us before? Ah? This is so— It’s just a real fucking mess now.,
You’ve made this very hard. But I’m here to find out what you want and to talk you down.,
That’s not happening in any event.,
Con.,
We’re just here on Dad’s behalf.,
What’s your point?,
Unsubscribe.,
He won’t be on trial for that.,
Well …?,
"Rome, defend Dad, fine? But Gerri can look after herself.",
You can’t hide under the covers with Mummy.,
You love showing your peepee to everyone but you know someday you’ll actually have to fuck something?,
Maybe I was a little—?,
‘Sorry’.,
"Right, well I didn’t know.",
Did you – Rome?,
What?,
I did not know that dancers were fucking for their jobs and I didn’t know they threw fucking migrants off boats and I did not know we covered that up as a matter of secret company policy. I did not know what they were laughing about.,
I didn’t get in the pool with any of those fucking creeps.,
No because I was fifteen.,
And are we excluded from the Kingdom of Heaven unless we accept the one true truth?,
So?,
Where are you at?,
"Right. We need to protect Dad. Because, if we knifed him now, it is true he would bleed out. So.",
Well that’s just true.,
"Rome, that is just a statement of fact.",
Yeah.,
I am not making fucky eyes at you.,
I am not.,
"All three of us? And Con? No. We all back Ken? He’s toast. He just is. I’m not saying we should do it, but it’s no good shirking. I mean fine, you can if you want, but we better know what the fuck we’re doing because this is a moment.",
"First it was Rhea, Gerri now? That’s not great?",
"He’s not infallible, Rome.",
"He missteps all the time, he’s not what you think he is. He’s not Dad, not when he was – you know?",
If we did that and we squared Frank. Karl? He would be toast.,
Yes-be.,
"Well, lot of fresh blood. Lot of fear. We pull the pin today, I think tomorrow, we could win a spooked board, take over. Which is— It’s interesting. —",
"Look. You win this, take Dad out, we risk losing control in the proxy battle. Shareholders don’t like confusion. I’m not sure the family comes through in control.",
Really?,
"Okay, no. In your position that just doesn’t work.",
"No. If I were to back you against Dad, you’d need to let me take over.",
"You’re a busted flush, I’m the only person who can reform.",
Bullshit.,
I need to make some calls.,
But this stays in here?,
"So, listen, Tom, I’m with Ken.",
Did you know?,
"He’s offering an alliance. Me, Rome and Con, we take Dad down?",
Yeah.,
How is Dad?,
Fuck. Is he okay?,
Okay? Wow?,
Uh-huh. But what do you think? Maybe we get you? And Frank?,
Exactly.,
"Oh, hi, Lisa. How you doing?",
"Wow, how funny, seeing you here. How interesting. What are you doing here?",
"Oh you’re repping my brother? Well this is awkward. What with us being old friends. Still – great that you’ve handled it so clean, you know, waiting to bump into me here on the stairs to let me know?",
What the fuck?,
Did you tell him?,
Oh fuck. What? Well I wouldn’t eat one.,
"I mean, sure but, I mean?",
"No, I’m with Dad.",
Because I am.,
Why? I don’t have to tell you.,
"Yeah, because you’ve always been so careful to keep me fully informed.",
"I know you’re angry but don’t project your own disappointment on to me, okay?",
I ought to go.,
"Fuck you, Armani Jesus.",
"Oh right, I was the only one that mattered, I was the only one you wanted?",
"Yeah yeah, I know. I fucking know.",
Thanks.,
For nothing.,
Sure. I mean you did a bit of positioning but—,
"I’m sorry, I didn’t know.",
"Good to have you back, Dad.",
Thanks for the donuts. I think they got shots of me through the window anyway.,
Sure. ‘Captain Cuddles’.,
I dunno?,
Uh-huh. What does it mean?,
"So, made-up?",
Uh-huh. A mascot?,
Ugh. You like the ending?,
I can – I can scope that out. But what are we doing to counter?,
Well we did discuss the town hall event?,
"I’m happy to lead that if we want, if it’s about change?",
"Yeah. ‘We Get It’ yeah could sound kind of like, ‘Yeah, yeah, we get it already, stop moaning about the rapes.’",
Dad?,
Whatever.,
Uh-huh. Like tanks? Or army men?,
Uh-huh.,
Me?,
"Right, and who is like me would you say?",
I think I’m best placed neutralizing Kendall.,
I always come.,
"Hehe. You know what, we do keep more newspapers alive and employ more journalists worldwide than any other company. So I guess we’re doing our bit?",
Wow we got to Stalin fast. Is Gil still turning up on  ‘by mistake’?,
Mhm. Hey.,
"I’m on the advisory. Whereas you’re – the newest attraction at the zoo. Half man, half Nobel Prize.",
"Wouldn’t it be amazing if you had an opportunity to do that in a public forum, like in Congress?",
Or the Khmer Rouge.,
He’s fine. Worried you might come in.,
"Yeah well that would just be dumb. We all need for us to win the shareholder vote. You too. Just wait a week, okay? And cool it on the interviews. That’s just smart all round.",
Uh-huh.,
"Look. I actually think we have the same aim here is the truth. Big picture. I’m tired of all this too. And I’m pushing for change. Like is there a world where maybe if you stop being gross and throwing stones, we can acknowledge, and rebuild. Truth and reconciliation. And, maybe we find a way to actually fucking fix things, from inside, which is the only place anything ever gets done?",
Or do you not actually give a fuck? And is it all just ego?,
You okay?,
I did.,
I don’t know. I don’t think so. I think he gets it.,
Isn’t Roman—?,
What is it exactly you want me to do?,
"The truth, but horrible, right?",
Yes. Of course. On what?,
‘Hullabaloo’? Yeah. I don’t know. Yeah. I mean. We can talk?,
We’re a big company. But how bad – is—? What is the worst thing that could be in those papers?,
Uh-huh.,
"Well I know that’s not true. Tom was in cruises, Dad, Bill told him. I know there were black ops, there was targeted intimidation of whistleblowers and victims, there was—",
You can’t just change your story …!,
"Well, you’re on emails?",
Yeah I know—,
Dad—,
Uh-huh?,
Such as?,
Uh-huh.,
The government has an unbelievable amount of leverage at its disposal. The law.,
Hey? Did you have a good night. Did you see your guy?,
"Oh, I’m sorry.",
Are you okay?,
"I don’t think so. I went to see my dad and— Yeah, I dunno. How was your guy?",
"Right. Fuck. Tom, it’ll be okay.",
Tom?,
Uh-huh?,
I don’t—?,
What cooperate?,
"Fuck. I don’t think you can do that though, Tom. You’re drunk. But it’s smart. It’s— I mean that is kind of a win from a no-win?",
I mean it’s punchy. And I guess there’s still a real chance no one goes to prison.,
"Either way, you bank gold with my dad? Right – the offer? It’s kind of genius?",
"Oh Jesus. But no. Tom, you can’t. You can’t. He’s got everyone doing fucking somersaults for him right now. I just guess, if you did, afterwards, we could do something?",
I don’t know. Get married!,
"I’m kidding. There was just so much going on last time. We could do it again. Just us. Renew or whatever, a month in Maui just us smoking weed and cuddling?",
What are they asking?,
I mean I have my speech all set – do we need to do questions?,
Dad can’t see this one. Or this.,
I think there might be about three here we can use.,
"Is it right, he’s on his way?",
"He’ll eat up any drama, Dad. What?",
"Can we please not turn this into the invasion of Normandy, okay?",
Dad! Stop.,
I know. I know. But let’s keep it cool.,
Sure. Good.,
And will Dad be nearby? Undermining my authority?,
"Um. I don’t. Some – some – people might think this – the issue – is a joke, but let me assure you, we take it very seriously— Can we kill that? Sorry. Look, later, there’ll be a chance for you to air any issues you want to discuss, and for us to listen … … in a non-judgmental environment. Can we do something about that?",
"Now, I talked Dad down. He wanted us to do a talk-show appearance. I thought us all on a couch would be very gauche. So I drafted this to land, and end debate. Dad wants us all to sign it.",
"That way it’s not … contestable. It’s not one person’s reputation on the line, it’s facts we are  saying.",
"I think a formal response, it draws a line under it and— I’m sure you’re getting asked, so this is just us clearly saying we’re not a part of Kendall’s – thing.",
You would have to say it’s accurate?,
I want us to sign up for release to all media tonight?,
"It’s all, basically, verified.",
Which of those isn’t true?,
"But he’s, he’s on a mission. He won’t stop unless we take his legs out.",
It’s much more powerful if it comes from all of us.,
Why not?,
Well that’s not a reason.,
"We all do things we don’t want to, Roman.",
Con?,
"Con, come on. Dad really wants this. It’s all true.",
What do you want?,
"It’s just a conversation, Ken.",
I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true.,
"Okay, sure – Mom.",
"You okay, Ken—? Cos you’re sounding a little slurred.",
For what it’s worth I agree with Ken.,
"You’re right. Smart move is, Dad cuts you dead. He goes in with me or maybe Roman – tells Aaronson we’re building a future without you and we tough it out.",
If he won’t go is it bad?,
"Uh-huh. I’m hearing the raid was a warning shot. Should calm down now we’re playing ball. Law firm and Gerri are ready to pour tons of chicken feed in. Gum up the investigation, buy us time.",
"Dad. You have two former deputy AGs. The former head of fraud at Main Justice. Ex-head of the FCPA unit. Former Crime Chief at SDNY. These are all-stars, Dad. The Harlem Globetrotters. Westchester Judge-Fuckers.",
You think he’ll respond well to pressure.,
Connor’s not a problem. Offer him VP of Shitting His Pants.,
"Okay, Dad. Absolutely.",
What?,
"Whoa, okay! Okay.",
"Are you okay, Greg? Were you – shouting?",
"Hey so, listen, Dad wants a host out criticizing the administration. What do you think about Mark? You wanna tell him or Cyd?",
"Well yes, Tom, I know that, but since I thought I was talking to my husband, I thought I could be a little more direct? It’s not a ‘release the hounds’ situation just a bit of barking from the kennels. Let the Raisin know how it feels when we get a little less friendly.",
What’s—?,
Tom. That’s – that’s not going to happen.,
Otisville? That’s the prison in Maryland—?,
Yes. Right. Right. Sorry. Dad and Ken just landed.,
It’s an ‘if’. Tom. Big fucking ‘if’.,
So – who tells Mark we want to send a shot across the bow? Will you make it happen?,
"He’s a little bitch. Once he gets it, he’ll do what my dad wants. Where’s he gonna go? Stormtrooper FM gonna pay him thirty million a year?",
But you’ll handle? Thanks.,
‘Corporate governance’?,
If you carve out from me it undermines me.,
Taking direction from a colleague is not being fucked in the ass by them.,
Tom – I’d like you to handle Ravenhead. Thanks.,
Thank you.,
Ha! Yeah. So. What can we do for you here?,
"So, shall I go or will you? We’re all very excited about the idea of working more closely with you.",
"Oh, you have notes—?",
"Okay, cards on the table, we were thinking of offering you Gourmando?",
You could do a wine-tasting show?,
I’m not sure we can give you a high-level executive role in the current climate.,
"Well, up to a point.",
"You already have our attention, Connor. I just think a lifestyle network or a stock situation might be easier to—",
"Let’s stay civil, Con.",
"Look, I get that this is uncomfortable but I have Dad’s direct authority.",
Dad – sorry. It’s me. Connor says he wants something bigger than Gourmando.,
Hey. Any updates from Dad?,
And where we at with the Sandy and Stewy negotiation?,
Oh yeah—?,
But in terms of the temperature?,
"Great, great. But just so I’m clear – we’re hung up on what exactly?",
"We’re still on that? I’m green so, apologies – but aren’t there bigger points like the standstill?",
"Sure but do we have time to find out? Or do we maybe send one of you two big-hitters to bang some heads, pull them out of the weeds?",
"Look. Whatever you think? Let me know how it goes. Well great. And any big news or vibrations, let me know.",
"Okay? Well, that’s unfortunate.",
But I hear Greg’s a lock? He signed the JDA. So – you nailed that?,
"You okay? Is it the seniority thing? The, the, prison possibility? —",
Tom.,
Tom. Baby? It’ll be okay.,
"Tom, I don’t know what to say. I haven’t got anything to say. Let’s talk at home. It won’t happen. I’m sorry. Listen, one tiny thing. Would it be fun for us to, push ‘go’ on the vineyard?",
"I was in a shitty mood. It might be fun? To have something growing? It could be fun – whatever happens, right? I should— Dad?",
Greg’s in. We just got signature copies.,
"Oh, okay well, fuck him, right?",
But you okayed me to go in and kick some ass and—,
"You give in to Karl, everyone starts carving me out. This is a line, Dad, and—",
Uh-huh. Okay.,
Hey. Sorry to barge in. Would you prefer for me to wait outside?,
Great.,
"Oh fine it’s not editorial. — So yeah it is editorial. I have a line for you, on the president, that we’d like for you to roll out starting immediately. We’re open to suggestions but we feel our general ideological sympathy has maybe let them off the hook on too many specifics. Middle East, big tech, green subsidies. We’d like this as a branded, nightly segment, maybe: ‘Losing His Grip’.",
"But with a question mark. Like, ‘Is he?’",
This is like our advice to our friend. You know?,
What rumors?,
"It’s okay. I called her already, to let her know we’d be having this conversation.",
"Mark – I get it – this is all new to me. I’m feeling my way here. Church and state, there’s editorial guardrails in place and I’m kinda merrily skipping over them. But this is something my dad wants. So, one: He has great antennae and you might like to back his hunches. But two: In a sense this conversation is already over. It’s just a question of how many times we scream the word ‘fuck’ at each other before you do what we want?",
"Yeah, you’re under contract so no one will touch you.",
Karl. Anything from the negotiations? Any kind of human communication would be good.,
Thanks. I mean it’s not. But thanks. I should look at my words.,
I dunno. Yeah. Terrible. I keep thinking is this real? But it really is real.,
How we looking?,
Fuck. Was there a deal there?,
We’re gonna lose the fucking company. Are we going to lose the fucking company today?,
"Yeah, um? Maybe not the best day for chat? No time.",
You heard where we’re at?,
So?,
And that’s it? No like last-minute—?,
The White House is shitting fuel rods about the tone change.,
We’re back on?,
Because they know it’s the smart option?,
"Well let’s find out, right?",
"Thanks, I no longer wish to receive these calls.",
"Look, if it’s helpful, I’m happy to talk to Sandi? Maybe there’s a connection? The daughter thing.",
"I just thought, if the traditional channels don’t work, maybe you could use me, as a fresh approach?",
Sure. Just an offer.,
"Including yours? Sure, we can do that right now, I have my dad’s authorization to go there.",
Those were his exact words?,
‘He  said yes’?,
There’s nothing to discuss. It fucks us and it’s designed to humiliate Dad.,
Is she going to fuck us?,
"Dad, they’re going to marinate on it, but I think I – we – did it. So, fingers crossed. You don’t mind me relaying the news?",
"Well, it’s not a done deal yet, Con. But it’s close! I think the lawyers can finesse the rest.",
They have nowhere else to maneuver.,
"Dad, how can it be bad for us?",
"Reopen the negotiation? Dad, are you serious? We settle now or we go to the vote and lose.",
"Christ, Dad, you just said it’s not far off what you originally offered. We fuck this, there are no more deals … Thanks, Dad. That’s smart. It is.",
Uhhm?,
What the hell was that?,
Okay. You wanna show me real quick?,
What – like—?,
Why is the shareholder meeting making you so incredibly horny?,
Someone could walk in.,
"What, some fucking proxy solicitor? We gonna ask some Dunder Mifflin guy to join in?",
"Tom, you’re not even hard, what is this?",
How’s the release coming? And who’s going to announce?,
"Dad, let’s just eat it, you can tell them to fuck off later …",
"Oh, sure, you need some help shall I reach out to—?",
We wanna make the decision now – before or—? We can wait I guess.,
"What’s it gonna be, Dad?",
"Dad, are you sure? You sure you want to do this? Dad? Are you okay? Do you know something?",
"I mean, he did say no, right? That was a clear no? Because—?",
But did he?,
"It’s a huge fucking gamble. For, what?",
No. So either you fold on the jets or we’ll take our chances on the vote?,
Then we’ll go to the vote.,
Fuck. Well. It’s done.,
"Dad, Ravenhead? We’re in the middle of daytime programming?",
More moaning about our coverage. Tell her he’s busy.,
"Yeah, we’ll call back.",
Dad? You okay?,
"Kerry, is Dad on any medication?",
Could his meds make him confused?,
Where are they? Does he have them?,
Okay. He’s got a fucking UTI.,
Fuck! How long’s he been like this?,
"No one hears of this! Look after him! Tom? Tom, what do we do?",
Oh fuck. He’s piss-mad.,
"When did he say that? Because he was out of it when he said that, definitely.",
I can guarantee he wasn’t. He’s been out of it for a while it sounds.,
"He could say anything. He could tell everyone he’s Barbra Streisand. No, we need to drop it.",
Hey? Any progress? We’ll push it as late as we can. And maybe if we just get him onstage that’ll be enough?,
Okay. Great.,
Why the fuck didn’t you tell anyone about this?,
"Well that worked out well. Oh, Christ.",
We are figuring it out.,
Like how quick?,
"Can we speed it up? A blood bag, or an adrenalin shot?",
"Fuck you, it’s what he’d want.",
"Well, obviously, I agree.",
I think his moaning’s getting louder so—,
Is it a wheel-on-and-wave?,
"Okay. He’s not doing a speech. So – what, we just fucking go down – that’s it, we give up? Talk to me.",
Okay. Listen. I think we go back to Sandy and Stewy and save the deal?,
"Dad didn’t say shit. His urethra had wrested control from his brain. I talk to them at least, right? It goes to a vote, we’re probably dead. Rome, you back this?",
"Hey. Thank you. So look. Upon further reflection, we have decided to accept your counter. We can eat the jets.",
We took another look and felt this was the clearest way forward.,
Yup. It is what my dad wants.,
He’s proud. He preferred me to let you know.,
Right. But we’re good? We’re going to be good?,
"Because we’re getting fucking close? So if we’re not good, you should say.",
"Right. I mean, can we figure something out here? It’s kind of now or never.",
"Look, look, I don’t think it’s right your dad sidelines you in all this. Maybe it’d be appropriate for me to have someone like- minded on the board? So how about—? How about …? How about a fourth seat on the board. For you. Tell him you screwed it out of us and my dad was losing his shit and it nearly killed him?",
"It’s one more than three by my count. For balance, Waystar would get an extra seat – for me.",
"If he needs one last push, explain the markets won’t ever let me or my brothers be CEO?",
I just care if your dad believes it.,
Thank you!,
A hotel? I mean – I think there’s rooms in the apartment we’ve never walked all the way into?,
What time—?,
Is this why you asked when my period was? Babe are you … tracking me?,
"Are you keeping a shadow log, Tom? Have you been watching the phases of the moon to see when I’m breedable?",
I said I didn’t like the timing.,
"Put one in, for when you’re out?",
"I don’t want to be your fucking incubator while you – do chin- ups and, and, read Knausgård.",
What?,
Can we take him out? Is there not a guy?,
"So, you did it. Congratulations.",
"Dad, the detail is good. The seat was the only way.",
"I stipulated we’d add a board seat of our own. We talked about that, right? Adding another person to the board, like me, or—? Or Connor, or whoever? We couldn’t risk a vote. You were – you were AWOL. What would you have done?",
Okay? But what would you have done?,
It’s been two minutes. Don’t you want to savor the fact we got through this alive?,
"Dad, take this, just for a toast!",
"Well somebody’s feeling better! Here’s to us, everyone!",
Okay? What’s—?,
Dad and Kerry? Please.,
He hates the close-proximity bang.,
Ugh. Please. You’d like to give him a blowjob. Stop projecting.,
"Sorry, you want to buy the hot social media streaming platform while railing against big tech?",
"And I guess, a bellyful of humble pie about – you know, accidentally knocking over their president and smashing him on the floor?",
"Dad, can I jump in with you. That okay?",
Can we go up a degree in the back? You okay?,
No. Just. The last time we talked properly you were humiliating me at the shareholders’ meeting. I thought it would be good to check in.,
And I’m just going to say. I’m concerned about who you might endorse this weekend. The vice president.,
Nothing as dangerous as a second-rate individual who sees his chance. He’s a silver-medal snake. He’s a neoliberal posing as a Maniac. He’s the nice guy who kills a stripper to fit in with the bros. Why do you even care who they pick?,
"C’mon, you’re a money guy. What’s the difference between us, politically, really? You want marginal tax rates at twenty, twenty- five percent? I want them at thirty, thirty-five?",
"Fine. I would also just say. I know you two are having your whatever moment but, this might not be the best place to let Roman be a mouthpiece.",
"Well, I’ve been to a heap of these in my time, you need the subtle knife. Not a dirty little pixie with a megaphone.",
"Well, I love him but he fucked the phone call with the Raisin, that’s an existential risk. The only solid thing he ever actioned in LA was , the movie about the man who could talk to cars? We’re walking into there with a hundred different aims. Some nuance is required— You know, I’m just glad we still have a company to be acting on behalf of, thanks to me.",
You can smell the panic. Berlin-bunker vibes.,
I’m just a corporate observer.,
This party is falling apart.,
The Maniacs are the moderating influence?,
Is it just me or in a room full of Timothy McVeighs does Connor suddenly look like a Roosevelt?,
Ron Petkus blew his son’s archery instructor. True story.,
That’s not really how it works.,
"So what are you hearing? MICHELLE-ANNE Well? With the president out we need a nominee. Welcome to clown town. Six months to election day and no candidate. Super Tuesday’s gone, ballots are finalized, nowhere to go now but a brokered convention. The delegates will choose at the RNC of course, but I think we can be real and say we need to choose here, first.",
Correct.,
"What, by winning? We threw them some board seats, fine. We’re still very much in charge.",
What?,
Is this a joke? Who is Peter Onion?,
She really hasn’t fucking told us she’s getting married? Call her.,
I don’t want to call her. She prefers you.,
Yeah I’m kinda curious.,
Did you know?,
I guess she took the view ‘fuck Rory’.,
She was probably too busy throwing away our old finger- paintings.,
"Uh-huh, what you doing with your weekend? Plotting to send us all to jail? Your favorite?",
Ugh. He’s such a fucking— And now Boyer’s losing juice. You hear?,
Mmm. Yeah? Yeah?,
"No good. Earthy. Yeah? It’s very, Germanic.",
"I wonder if Boyer flames out, if it’s time to pivot party?",
You’re tired. It’ll feel better tomorrow.,
"Tom, I don’t get why you want to keep talking about it? What else is there to say?",
C’mon. You’re obsessing. I can’t keep going round and round. Honey. I don’t know what to say. No?,
What to – making love?,
Jesus. She’s cucked you so hard. Wait … are you sad?,
Did you hope Mummy and Daddy would get back together?,
"Me? Just shopping here in the marketplace of ideas, Rick.",
The total fucking whack jobs?,
You know our internals always said you had the best shot of making the math work.,
"ATN hasn’t given you a lot of shine, it’s true.",
"Sir, you are very forward!",
Oh will you now?,
Very funny.,
Unless he resigns in a month!,
"Oh, man. Good stuff. Funny.",
So fucking boring.,
"No, nothing. I’ve just seen your thing quite a lot.",
"Oh, you know. YouTube provocateur bullshit, aristo-populism, rape is natural, ‘it’s all red pill, baby.’ I’m just over it.",
"Yeah. I’ve forgotten it, what happens?",
Don’t want to! Don’t want to!,
Have you told Dad yet?,
"Oh my god, can you stop being obsessed with Mom’s husband, who cares, get over it.",
"Should we not kick it around? I mean – I mean, it feels like it’s poised so, if you and Petkus come together and the other donors follow then—",
Honestly? I think you go Dems.,
Rome. No disrespect. Boyer’s yesterday’s papers. The Dems will run on change and blow him away.,
Roman. Boyer’s not a winner. We know that.,
"Look. Okay. Can I just say. No. Okay? Mencken is— He’s a nativist integralist fuckhead. He’s toxic. ‘Medicare for All, Abortions for None’. His idea of diplomacy is shooting roe deer with Viktor Orbán and then starting a trade war with China. I’m tough, I know there’s the fucking carnival bark and then there’s the show but, he’s outside the American political tradition. I just think Waystar, we have a certain responsibility, to, like, the American Republic and for the future of the— For kids, and— Fuck you, Roman.",
He’s talked about burning Korans and licensing press credentials?,
He’s opening it and throwing union organizers out of it.,
Stop being a dirty little pixie whispering swastikas in Dad’s ear.,
I’m not saying it’s going to be full Third Reich. But I think there’s a genuine possibility we slide into some Russian-Berlusconied- Brazilian fuck-pile.,
"What about considering the other way though, Dad? The Dems?",
Not if he doesn’t win. Which he won’t.,
Did Willa tell you to say that?,
"Look. If you’re not going to go blue, then it has to be Salgado?",
"Look, I don’t like him, he’s a neocon pretending to be a paleocon but he talks base and he’ll bring new demographics.",
Amazing! Just racist. Just being a racist now?,
"‘Mummy loved me too much because I was the runt of the litter.’ Haven’t you got a message from Mum for Dad, Rome? —",
Salgado has a great narrative?,
"‘Ooh I’m Roman, I’m a rebel, except where’s a big daddy? Please rule me, please punish me.’",
"Con? Um, well, you know?",
"Well, not huge name ID but – the family name will be a factor—",
I mean he doesn’t have a track record?,
"I guess, in terms of presentation and connection skills …",
"Look. I love Con, I do. But if we’re talking about him seriously I think we have to look at Salgado. Can I get him up here?",
He is not nice.,
"Yeah, Dad. Let’s invade Poland. No downside.",
His chief of staff broke a kid’s jaw at a rally.,
"It is not even! I’m sorry. But my opinion counts more, okay? It does. It just does. I know this. Okay? I know. People hate the guy.  him. You need to look at the climate —",
"Seriously, is this how it happens? Dad. C’mon. Seriously, he’s just – he’s fucking dangerous.",
"It’s funny, here I thought you were gonna be the guy who put my dad in prison?",
Um. Right?,
"With him? Um, No.",
We’ve got enough people in the shot. I’m good.,
"Look, I’m not standing next to him. I’ll be in the photo, but not right by him?",
"Uh-huh. I think this is— great work, Rome. But obviously the main thing is, the organizational–cultural thing. I think everyone agrees GoJo makes sense. No one needs persuading of that.",
It’s just about us here who get it— oiling the wheels and making sure – there’s no friction.,
"Great. I’m just saying, big picture.",
"Ken Fest? I wouldn’t think so. I mean maybe if Matsson does, for follow-up?",
Aww. ‘Brudders’.,
Is Matsson here already?,
It’s like he’s having a midlife crisis aged eighty.,
"Rome, he’s fucking an assistant who’s fifty years younger than him?",
"Did you do it already, Dad? You didn’t land GoJo already without us?",
"Well, congratulations, Dad. You’ve done it again. It’s great. But let’s try hard not to do it again, right? But no. Lessons learned. Here’s to Tom!",
He’s sent sherpas. He’s not coming.,
"What’s the downside – meet this guy, could read petulant not to?",
But have we? It might be our last chance to avoid the legacy- media graveyard.,
Seriously? We’re going after Pierce again?,
Fine. Matsson is an asshole. Of course he is. So we should burn our life raft over ?,
"Dad, this is it. We have a scale issue. Our streaming platform is for shit. We have nothing which looks like growth. This gets us consequentially into streaming, it gets us into social media, sports betting and turbo-boosts our AI. We have a  window. Back out now and we end up a pilot fish nibbling the leftovers from between Bezos’s fucking teeth.",
"We appreciate your input, Kerry, but ‘fuck him’ is not good tactics.",
"Dad, if you don’t want to talk to him, fine. But let me. Please.",
On it.,
"Hey, you don’t need my permission. Like how fucked up?",
Um. Can we leave already? Do a FaceTime with Matsson instead?,
Sorry. Gross. You’re gonna need to tase us.,
So where’s Tabs?,
‘Busy’? Again. Uh-huh. Did you kill her?,
"Oh yeah? That beautiful fascinating blonde VC, she’s boring you?",
"Okay? But the relationship was fine, sexually, and you were loving the  and all.",
Uh-huh?,
Oh Jesus.,
Cold and inhospitable. Which seems to check out.,
Do they show where the fun is?,
What’s it say?,
"No, the mirror was Mom. Dad was never there to see us cry.",
"Okay, so where’s Matsson?",
"Hi. Um, do you know where Ken is?",
"Shouldn’t it be empty then? Happy birthday, old man.",
"Couldn’t find one that said, ‘Happy Fortieth’  ‘Get Well Soon’.",
It’s a ten-minute drive.,
"Okay, hug before you start weeping?",
"So. Go on, who’s here?",
Your mom.,
"Business folks? Stewy? Honestly, we could do with building some bridges. Lawrence Yee? Lukas Matsson?",
Sure. That’d be nice. — Does he seem okay to you?,
"Okay, I have a location.",
Okay. But easy. Do not fuck this.,
"If we miss this, in eighteen months we’ll be dead, begging some rinky-dink Facebook whistleblower to redesign our whole bullshit from the bottom up.",
Right. The gentle touch. Profanasaurus Rex. Might be safest if it’s me?,
Well maybe knuckle-dragging white nationalists are your intellectual level. And maybe I should talk to Matsson.,
"‘Come play in my treehouse, Drake.’ Which one is this based on?",
Right. Where he got so mad when we got in that he pinned you down and had Ray Raleigh spit in your mouth? Hey—,
Ha. Sure. It’s the coolest grown man’s treehouse I’ve seen in quite a while.,
Is it ‘borderline personality disorder’?,
Ken? C’mon.,
You know what happens if you let us in? And we talk to him? Either we strike out and – nothing. Or we succeed and Waystar benefits and your net worth goes up by several hundred million dollars.,
"Uh-huh, and a butt infection. What offer? What’s he talking about?",
You and Dad?,
Right. You ‘’?,
Okay. So can I be the name on the piece of paper instead?,
Right I just guess who owns the company has historically been of some interest?,
Yeah it’s bullshit. Roman and Dad necking in the catbird seat. Did you hear any whispers about this buyout thing?,
"You’re harshing your own mellow, babe. I think I’m just gonna hit Matsson on the way out. I have eyes on it and—",
"Rava? Hey. My god, an actual person!",
"I came in through my mother’s pussy so, yeah. That was fun. Are you going, are you coming to my mom’s wedding?",
"Okay, well. Listen, we should do a lunch – it was always fun when we—",
Oh we’re allowed! I’ll allow it.,
Uh-huh? As in—?,
"Oh Mencken? Yeah, no I’m okay. Yeah no.",
Oh right. I just keep off the social media I guess. ‘Nazi arm candy’?,
"I was there to help my dad, and keep us honest.",
It wasn’t a big deal so—,
"What are you up to? What’s going on, did you get to Matsson? I heard you were speaking?",
Yeah I was dancing.,
You spoke to him though?,
And?,
"Fuck you, c’mon.",
"Hey come on, seriously, Rome.",
"Roman, just, fucking, I want to know what was said because this is important. I might need to finesse.",
No by making sure—,
"Dude, if you want to show off maybe do it to someone who gives a shit. Like your girlfriend? Oh no, wait, has she left you?",
"Dude, I’m the one in a functioning relationship.",
I don’t drink on work days. I have self-control.,
"No one likes talking about me fucking guys as much as you, you know that? Why is that? Is it cos you’re the COO who can’t fuck?",
"He’s using you as the messenger boy because you’re easily controlled. But as usual, you’re too dumb to see it.",
"You’re a real piece of shit, you know that?",
You’re fucking gross and you betrayed me.,
"Rome, c’mon?",
"Yeah, well, we haven’t been getting on very well lately, have we?",
"Lay off the drugs, Ken. We’re not are we, Rome?",
"Well, that  disgusting.",
"No, I’m just saying there’s a fucking line.",
Uh-huh.,
No. I’m gonna call in.,
Yesss.,
Yes. I just still feel how I was feeling. So.,
"I need Fatima to pack for me, I can’t face packing but yes. Can you message Fatima to pack when she comes?",
I’m not feeling great. There’s nothing really to say.,
Hey.,
You sounded dumb at the board meeting.,
"Uh-huh, where’s Tabitha? Has she found someone a little more emotionally available? Like a stick of Wrigley’s Spearmint gum?",
What a lovely wedding present.,
Do what?,
Whatever.,
Fuck it.,
She’s probably in sexual thrall to him. He’s driving her crazy with his sugar dick and there’s nothing we can do?,
"Well, yes I am.",
"What, poor old Eleanor Rigby wants to eat dick and drink champagne for the rest of her life instead?",
You ask about the prenup?,
Oooh. Here he is. Full Metal Kendall. Back from birthday ’Nam.,
Punching above your weight there?,
Spite date?,
Well even if it doesn’t work out I guess she’s a great date ladder?,
"Well because people will look at her, with you and, no offense, they will say, ‘What’s going on there?’",
"So it’s a good moment. Tom, like honestly I might not have looked twice if it wasn’t for Deana.",
I think she’s a princess or a duchess or something.,
Oh god. Poor woman. Look at that. She probably thinks she’s met a ‘fun guy’ at a wedding.,
"He should have to ring a bell as he walks, or emit a stench.",
"He should have ‘Just a Husk’ tattooed on his forehead. Okay. Scary Poppins is on maneuvers. Don’t let her be nice to me. She knows I’m not in a great place and then, it’s House of Flying Daggers. She’s gonna wanna know how my marriage is going. And if I’m gonna have kids and—",
‘Haha.’ Oh fuck. Tom? Matsson.,
Is he rocking the boat? Is he trying to blow up the deal? What does it mean? Has he got good subscriber numbers coming?,
What the fuck is this?,
Sounds cool. Is he going to steal our watches while he saws the fucking deal in half?,
"I think he’s played you, Rome?",
Okay! New one. Emojis: Controller. Fingers crossed. Eggplant.,
I think it’s betting. It’s a betting firm tie-up or something.,
"Keep decoding the hieroglyphics, Gerri. This is bad, Rome.",
"Yeah because, he blows the deal up, who is left for us, exactly? We could become the fucking Pan-American Waystar- Blockbuster Video Dial-up Corporation?",
And here she comes. Little Miss Steamed Spinach. The side dish.,
And you know the story?,
"Um. Yeah, me and Rome are kind of working on a big deal and we’ve just got hit with a kind of a torpedo so …",
Oh? Sorry. Lot going on.,
They offered to take photos and I think they took a screenshot of my address book.,
"So listen. Rome’s concerned. You do have a watertight prenup, right?",
You have a good lawyer at least?,
Has he not got one?,
Quite the business brain.,
Well – I guess opposites attract.,
"Me, get your attention? I think that ship sailed a long while ago.",
You weren’t a spotty mother. You were just – an absence. But I’m fine.,
"Mum, it’s okay. You let Dad take us and that was probably best.",
Sure. I didn’t choose anything.,
And you don’t?,
"I was ten, Mom. I was a fucking kid.",
Yeah? Where’s the onion?,
Well you’re my fucking onion too.,
Well you could have had dogs?,
Awful. You?,
Let’s have a baby.,
"I’m gonna fucking fight, Tom.",
You don’t just get given these things at a house in the fucking Hamptons.,
"I’m not gonna get given the top job, or ATN. You have to fight! I have to fight Gerri and Roman and Ken. But I can, because I’m smarter than them.",
"I’m going to do it. And fuck Dad, it doesn’t matter how often he kicks me. Ten years or five, get rid of Cyd. Remake ATN, destroy it, raze everything there.",
Yeah except you. Dad’s got spooked by Matsson. I need to find another deal. A bigger deal. Fucking nail it.,
"Together. We can’t let the dirty little pixie become king. Blow up Roman, I’m the only candidate left. Let’s do anything. Let’s— What do you want to do to me? Anything.",
"C’mon. Tell me anything, do anything.",
You’re notgood enough for me.,
I’m way out of your fucking league!,
That’s why you love me.,
That’s why you want me.,
Even though I don’t love you.,
But you want me anyway!,
"Well, GoJo price has lurched up. And held.",
"Keeps going, by midweek their market cap is gonna be close to ours. Roman’s not gonna find the landing zone for this. You okay?",
I was just being horrible – for fun? Dirty fun.,
"Come on, what happens in Sex Vegas?",
"Tom, you can’t ask someone to say terrible things and then get all— That’s a bit – manipulative?",
"Yeah. Yes, I think. One way or another. No? Let’s freeze at least.",
"Embryos survive way better than eggs. So we could put it together and have that, for whenever …?",
"Well, Tom, it’s important … the host chamber is willing! They keep them ten years, then – you know. You can work something out. It’s different if one of us dies, or if you are in a long-term coma, you can decide what should happen. I wouldn’t just automatically get them, if we divorced or something. If that’s what – concerns you?",
"I just think it’s smart to bank some embryos, see where we are.",
"It’ll get clearer. It’s just the option. And if something happens, or change your mind, they can destroy them, it doesn’t bind you.",
"Oh, okay. Well, thank you.",
Would I want you to—? Um. Can I think?,
"Look, I may not love you but I do love you, you know?",
Okay?,
"Baby popsicles, baby!",
You’re certain?,
Merger of equals?,
"But the full – fifty-fifty board, all stock. Dad splits control?",
"Right well, I don’t think— Dad?",
"But, Dad, yeah, ‘merger of equals’?",
It would be real scale. It’s a legitimate shot at staying relevant.,
I mean the top team will obviously— You’ll be fighting for your lives?,
Yeah that’s his dick. He’s sent you a photo of his dick. By mistake.,
He meant to send it to Gerri.,
"Well, honestly … Look, he’s weird about Gerri, everyone knows it. And to be honest I think it’s fucking disgusting.",
Gerri’s probably not stopping it for leverage. Banking it as ammo.,
"No. No, I’m afraid not. It’s a potential problem. There’s issues. He used to get jacked off by his personal trainer. There’s something going on with Gerri— He’s an unexploded bomb. So as we move forward—",
"Sorry about all this, Gerri. I just want to get things clear about what’s going on? And most importantly, if you’re okay?",
I just want to get things clear for my dad. This must be really hard.,
Okay. And has this or something like this ever happened before?,
"If it did, did you ask him to stop?",
"I mean, you weren’t – welcoming – these items, were you, Gerri? It’s just something for your well-being we need to be really clear about. With all this potential upheaval, and at such a delicate time, career-wise, for you as interim CEO, if you can’t deal with your own sexual harassment, not a good look.",
Uh-huh and would you like to make an official complaint against him regarding this?,
It’s something to pass the time I guess? —,
"What? I thought that would kinda be your dream, Rome? Me fucking Gerri, with your dick.",
Sure.,
"Come on, BPD, pay up.",
Such a cynic.,
"Yeah. So rude. Marry him, Willa. Go on. Think of the fun you’ll have with his motorized wheelchair once he’s gone?",
By turning on the bigot spigot to full gush?,
Fine. Okay. What? I’m only stealing so I can win?,
Never finished a book.,
"‘Oh I’m Roman in a shame spiral because my jerk matron has met an age-appropriate attorney.’ Okay, here he comes, nice, yeah?",
Thanks. And we appreciate what you did.,
"He fell off an air bed, he’s fine.",
"I’m sure, they can stay the night if you like?",
Are you – driving?,
"Jesus, Ken.",
"Thanks, Comfrey. Listen, we might wanna do something with him, before he goes. We might need you to nudge, okay?",
"Is Dad gonna pull the plug? Is GoJo? Rome—? He swallowed the merger, I’m not sure how much more fucking around he’ll eat?",
"Dad, if you want—?",
So?,
Merger of equals?,
Is it happening?,
"Ken. Take a seat. Look, Ken, we all just wanted to get together here to tell you that we love you.",
Right?,
"We just wanted to say we— A lot has been said – but we do all want you to be – okay. Basically, okay? We want that.",
Suicides jump the line.,
"You’re an addict. You’re addicted to booze and drugs and to relationships and to sex and to work, and to the family drama.",
Legal papers on Instagram? Another fucking tell-all interview they don’t even want?,
"I’ll lead, yeah?",
"Sure, man.",
"Sure, obviously, Con. But you know what he means?",
"Hey, easy. It’s okay.",
"Where is Dad? Is he just not going to come? I mean, what the fuck? Rome? Where is he? Is the deal good?",
What the fuck does that mean? Who made you the Wizard of Fuck?,
Rome. We’re about to go in.,
You’re not sure if he’s ‘the one’?,
"She has a prenup, she had her lawyer on it because she wants to keep the London flat she got from Dad.",
"And what about, even worse, what if he fucks her? With his dick? What if he fucks her so good she dies?",
"Hey, Rome. I have an idea— When she comes past, why don’t you tell her you love her?",
"Imagine how romantic it would be if you could marry Mummy today, on her wedding day!",
Tell them you know a reason they can’t be married. She’s the only one who makes her son’s peepee go boom-boom.,
Do you think she knows something? What if it’s all fallen apart? I hear he’s back. Why hasn’t he come down?,
"‘Cool beans’? Since when do you say cool beans? You’re bebopping cos you have no fucking clue, do you?",
"Um, so listen I think we should say sorry and—",
Oh. She said yes?,
Does she know where Dad is?,
So why is Kerry sandbagging?,
Jesus Christ.,
Finally you’ve found a worthy adversary. Bullshit rumors that Dad’s trying to – to raise the . Cranking the trebuchet. Trying for a baby. Maybe that’s where he is?,
"Okay well if you wanna do the public announcement, I guess you’ve got me.",
Larry Vansitart? To Matsson? Why does—? That would mean financing? Why does Matsson need financing if we’re doing an all-stock deal?,
"What the fuck, Roman? I thought you were inside this?",
"Okay. Sure, scale the fucking north face of the Eiger.",
Hey. How you doing there?,
"Right. Um, I heard, I heard you might be— Do you know where my dad might be at? And what he’s doing?",
"Right? And so, what’s going on for you?",
"Um, yeah, tough, I don’t know, tough, you know, fitting in at work, I’m trying but it can be difficult sometimes to feel I am really progressing, it’s a tough environment.",
"It is, it is difficult, it is. But – I mean how you finding it, the new ‘set-up’ sort of thing?",
"Uh-huh. Yeah? I’m just saying hi, Marcia, and if you ever want to talk, you can talk to me. I’m here.",
"I’m just – I’m sorry, we never talked, or really connected and— You know, I hardly know anything about you and – everything, you know?",
"Right. Well. I mean. Can I ask now? I mean. I know, obviously you grew up – in what in – in Israel and – then in Lebanon, in the seventies and eighties? What was that all like?",
"I’m trying to be real here. I can be open, I can tell you my shit if you want, I’ve got a ton of shit I am happy to unload for you. C’mon though. Was it tough? Did you see a lot of – suffering?",
Fuck. Okay. I’m sorry. Really?,
"Well okay, I’m sorry.",
"Okay. Look, I really want to know what my dad is up to. And I think you’ve been kind of screwed by my dad, so? Right? No?",
Offering. Um? I dunno. What have you got?,
"What the fuck is happening, Roman? Are we being fucked? Karl? Really?",
"We need to put a penny in the slot to make her talk. She’s throwing out bullshit. And where the fuck did Gerri go, you see that? This is fucking ugly, Roman, can you see what I can see?",
Uh-huh. And what did Dad say?,
"Oh Jesus Christ. Ken. Hey, Ken!? We might need to talk. Company stuff.",
"Ken – five please. It’s fucking important. We might need your line to Frank or Stewy, okay?",
"Ken, Dad’s doing us dirty.",
He ‘kind of shut it down’? Cos a minute ago he told him ‘fuck off’.,
"Larry Vansitart is in Switzerland with Matsson, so he’s looking for financing. Dad’s huddled with Karl and Frank who have flown in. Our market caps have tipped. The local town has been bought out by a new set of advisors, something’s flipped. I hear the deal code names have even changed.",
I mean – would he?,
"And if he did, would we get— I don’t know— protection?",
"Wait—? Do you have an angle on this, Ken? Are you speaking with Matsson? Laird called me. What’s that?",
"I think, I mean it feels like we’re the target, Rome, it just does, right? Ken. We have to go and stop this.",
Are you okay?,
It’s okay.,
Uh-huh. What?,
Is this – is this real. What?,
What?,
"What – the kid? That waiter kid who—? Really, Ken?",
Oh fuck. What?,
"Let’s get out of here. Let’s get you out of here, okay? Ken. It’s okay. It’s okay.",
Okay?,
What we gonna do? Where do we go?,
Laird called back. One minute.,
Oh yeah I’ve killed a coupla kids. Sure. Just little ones. You ruined my wedding so many ways.,
"Okay. Okay. Okay. I’m sorry, Ken – but – but I do have to just say, confirmed. Laird’s inside the deal. But he’s been cucked out of the lead. So he’s bitter and bleating. GoJo buys Waystar. They pay a premium. Dad cashes out. Cash and stock. Maybe he keeps a title or takes some assets but it’s Matsson’s board.",
"Ken, I mean, I know it’s not ideal, I know. But we need to talk. Can we talk?",
Daddy explain it all?,
He wouldn’t be in charge.,
"Well he wouldn’t be in charge, Rome.",
"Well it’s hard for you to see anything, because you’re still so ‘deep inside the deal’.",
Why?,
Mm?,
"Okay. Look, we need to go stop him. So, Ken. Where do you wanna be?",
You think you’re close to him? You’re just his – little rat-fucker.,
Why is it I’m getting Normandy beach vibes here? Looking around the landing craft and I’m in with a load of fucking balloon animals?,
"You think Daddy’s protecting you? We let Matsson take control, that’s Dad slamming the door. It means he doesn’t think any of us can, should, or will ever take over.",
Which is what? A hard drive full of dick pics?,
Where do you think we fit on Matsson’s new org chart?,
Man? C’mon.,
"Dad’s not going to choose you, Rome, because he thinks there’s something wrong with you. And I’m sorry but maybe it’s time we said these things, to each other? Instead of talking it all out to . Because this is going to be a moment of huge leverage but, Ken, if we’re going to work together you can’t ever be the boss of me. It just does things to me when you start using that voice and acting – all, I’m sorry but I can’t have that.",
"Right. Uh-huh. Time to rip off the Band-Aid. Push him out. Just get him on his own and say, fucking – urinary tract, the shareholder meeting?",
"He’s out of it, he’s fucking a twenty-year-old, planning for babies in jars? He’s gone loopy and tried to sell the shop. Seriously, just fucking his assistant, if we tell that to the board? He’s toast.",
"Right. Slide him out. Say, Ken Chair? Me or you CEO, Rome. Other one takes, like, whatever they want, the studio, movies, TV, all media, the streamer. Equal.",
Yes. We can fucking fight it out. It’ll be fun!,
I think we can get Marcia to fuck him on his health. For a price.,
"I have Gerri in my pocket. Thanks, Rome.",
And how do we feel about killing Dad? Mixed feelings right?,
Okay. Okay?,
"High up. There’s a lot going on, Tom. We’ll figure that out.",
"But, Tom? Once we do it, right away, we’re gonna offer him the medical card, secure the imperial guard. Tell him he needs some rest. And sourced to us kids, we get ATN to confirm. ‘Founder Logan Roy ailing’. ‘Prayers for the big man’. ‘Thinking of taking a step back’.",
"Yeah. We’ll stand it up. So get ready, okay?",
We good?,
"What if Dad flutters his eyes at you, Rome? You gonna melt?",
‘Waterpistols in Bali’?,
Don’t recall.,
"Yeah, that we’re the target now?",
"Is that right, Dad?",
"Right, it could just affect our positions – so we wanted to get some clarity?",
Someone’s always on top.,
"And so I think we would say, can you ease up and let us in? Stop this until we see how exactly we’re impacted?",
Why?,
"Right. Well, no arguing with that?",
Well—,
"Right, that, versus your kids?",
"Dad, once Matsson is calling the shots, we’re fucked.",
So why are we not inside this? If it’s so exciting?,
"We’re gonna get fucked, Dad. With you at the top we can take over. Without you, we get fucked.",
You can’t trust him.,
We can stop you. We will stop you and blow this up.,
"You need all of us, you need a supermajority and we will kill it.",
Well no because you have to—,
"Mom—? Are you serious, already?",
"Mom, you just slit our throats—",
Who told him? Who told him we were coming so he got to Mom before we could—,
"Well thank you. No, it is interesting. JIMÉNEZ STAFFER You can basically write your own brief.",
"Well that’s very nice of you to say and I’m flattered, but I guess is it a real role? JIMÉNEZ STAFFER Can I just ask if you have other offers?",
"Hey. T? I think the money is arriving? And, Rome, your security is being weird with them – they seem very stupid and probably racist.",
"I like this place. If I were a wildfire, I’d have first dibs on this fucker.",
Traffic. And a call. Business. For this. Good contact.,
What?,
What?,
"Well, no.",
I mean I have talked to them. I’ve been helping them out a little bit as you know.,
"I returned a call. They want to talk about talking. What? They haven’t won the election, they might not. Maybe Dad won’t sell, maybe you two will bail, it’s a ‘maybe maybe maybe’ situation.",
"Well, it’s just a big step, okay? Can’t we keep some options?",
"Well, me too. Me too.",
"No. No, I don’t. Do you?",
"And this is— Who is this – the flakey money, Nabby and the J- Fund?",
"This is informal today, right?",
"Okay, fine. Let’s dry-run it.",
"Hey! So, we’re looking for investment partners for a revolutionary new media brand that will redefine news for the twenty-first century.",
Hey?,
"I’m good, how are you, what is it?",
You’re ‘informing’ me?,
"Sorry, you’re asking me, or informing me? —",
So then why are you letting me know?,
"You know what, it’s fine. You’re dating my brother’s ex.",
And yet you are telling me?,
"Tom, seriously, knock yourself out. Nail her in the coat check. The kid from St Paul has really made it!",
"You don’t discuss something that’s already happening. ‘Hey, Shiv, me and Naomi are at the Pierre and I’m inside her and I was checking how you would feel about me ejaculating?’",
So what’s going on? Why are you meeting with her?,
Sure.,
Great. Let’s do this.,
"Yeah. It’s fine but apparently, Tom’s out with Naomi Pierce? Did you know this?",
"I don’t know. Are you and her, where are you at with her?",
"Okay, well, now she’s fucking Tom apparently, so?",
"It’s fine. I’m actually fine. He’s not, I don’t think. They were just meeting, apparently. Let’s do this.",
"He says no. But at the Mark, and worried about phones and gossip? I dunno. I guess – it’s— It probably isn’t [a date] … Honestly? Right. Naomi? . Dad?",
"What, so Naomi, Anne Pierce?",
I guess? You think?,
"Yeah – doesn’t feel, I mean he’s a sociopath but – I don’t think he’d be a good torturer – not cos he doesn’t have the stomach, he just doesn’t have the patience.",
"We should discuss, right?",
Can we get— Can they come back tomorrow? Because— Roman’s not feeling well.,
Or me?,
"I guess maybe, ‘fuck The Hundred’?",
I do like it. I do. Could we do both?,
"Sure, but there was always the thing of – is it a bit college-town fucking bookstore?",
"What’s it at now? Halved – more to what, eight or nine bil? After the sale we’ll have two to three bil. That’s our nut.",
And as a business it’s a lot better than the made-up company of dreams we were ready to pitch.,
"I do love it. It’s very exciting. It’s just kinda bullshit. Seriously, Rome, I want to do something. There’s a seminal election on. It’s fucking 1933. I wouldn’t mind having a say?",
"If we wanted to put something together to buy Pierce, could you swing that?",
Oh he recalls?,
"Who do we call? Do we call Naomi? Do we call Nan? Who are their bankers, T? You wanna makes some calls?",
Did she say no?,
Uh-huh?,
"So. Um, yeah. It is Dad. Complicated woman. Um, it was like: ‘No, no, my mind is made up, I’ve given my word, I’m honor-bound.’ But also, how soon can we be there?",
"I think she hates Dad, but she – maybe wonders if we’re, fake fruit, display only. I don’t know?",
Agreed.,
"It makes sense, Rome. We want to do something together. We know news, entertainment. It’s off the shelf, it’s got progressive roots, it’s— Yeah. Tom Wambsgans’ ATN versus our PGN?",
Chance to make amends. And get rich … er.,
"No. The other shit felt good. But yeah I like this. Besides, everything might fall apart— he might kill a guy and get high, you might get your dick stuck in an AI jerk machine. I have to look after myself because no one else fucking will, okay?",
"Honestly, I wouldn’t be doing this to get back at Dad … but it doesn’t bother me if it hurts him. I think you’re scared of this because you don’t want the conflict.",
"Seriously, Rome, we’re not raising a banner saying ‘Fuck you Dad’, it’s a banner saying: ‘We’re doing our own thing, we’re happy.’",
New mom calling.,
Tell her you’d be able to hear her better if she took Dad’s cock out of her mouth.,
Is he apologizing?,
"Maybe, maybe a hello, if he was to apologize. .",
"Yeah great. I guess. What? I’m busy, sure I’d like to fly over on weekends to float around wearing a straw hat surrounded by the toddlers they keep for me in cold storage, but you know, been busy. The Hundred. And – saving democracy. Hosting fundraisers.",
Great. Good to see you. Lovely place.,
Whereby we all hate him.,
He’s lying.,
"After this election we all, the country, could be in a bad place, I could, we would, maintain your values. —",
We’re confident we could be competitive.,
We have our resignation letters written. The GoJo deal signs in forty-eight hours.,
"Well, I’m going to be getting a divorce. So.",
"Tellis, are you there?",
"We’re starting at eight? We’re going to go in and say eight, yeah?",
"Hi, yeah we’re looking at, I think we’re very relaxed about the eight billion landing spot.",
They like eight.,
Hello? Tom? He wants a discussion?,
"What did he go up to, Tom?",
Oh come on. You can tell me. Did he go to nine? He didn’t go to nine did he?,
What’s Dad’s ceiling?,
Our ceiling is twelve.,
Yup.,
"I think he’ll go to nine, nine-five. So I think we need to be at nine-five. I think, Tellis, right?",
It rounds it out.,
Ten?,
Hello?,
"Sorry, did I wake you?",
"Yeah, I need wardrobe access actually. Sorry.",
"Uh-huh, I don’t want to be restricted to my favorites.",
I hear you and Greg call yourselves the Disgusting Brothers now?,
"That’s pretty cool? Do you have a logo? Do you do ‘The Rules’, is Greg your ‘wingman’?",
That’s so cool. And I hear you date models now?,
You look good. Ripped.,
"Did you get ‘buff’ for the models, Tom? Do you get them back here and do positions? Do you do all the positions with models now, Tom?",
How’s Mondale?,
"Uh-huh. Well, I think – things have become quite complicated. I wonder if there’s even a way through this?",
I wonder if we’ve run out of road?,
I wonder if we might want to make it official?,
I don’t want to rake up a lot of bullshit for no profit.,
"No, Tom. Okay? I don’t know if it’s good for me to hear all – that. I think it might be – I think it might be time for me and you to move on.",
Sure.,
"Tom, I think we can talk things to death but actually, we both just made some mistakes and I don’t think a lot of crying and bullshit is going to help, so if you’re good I think we can just make quite an adult split here and walk away with our heads held high and say, good luck. Yeah?",
"Would you like to? I don’t think so, Tom.",
I’m tired. But you can stay there if you like.,
Connor. Again. ‘Have we left yet?’ Eyeballs emoji. Fingers crossed emoji. Helicopter emoji.,
This needs the living shit kicked out of it.,
Gotta say the upside is huge if they broaden out and stop over- indexing to wine moms.,
It does sound a bit like ?,
Sounds kinda Dad?,
"Oh yeah? With Tom? He went with Gretchen? Okay, who’s second position?",
"Okay, sure.",
"Uh-huh. And Kohlmeyer, and Bulloch, and Camden—?",
"Yeah, yeah. Where are we, uh?",
"Sure, three-hour commute and I can still hear a highway and smell an incinerator.",
"Candice. Shall, I actually call Gary? Not even a soft pitch just ‘Hiya?’",
Uh-huh? So you’ve met or retained every useable divorce lawyer in New York to fuck me?,
"You think I don’t recognize my own dad’s playbook? Fuck you, Tom.",
"Uh-huh. Sure, Tom. Well, listen, if you’re going to be my dad’s little bitch boy, how about you deliver this message to him, bitch boy? Tell him to fuck off and stay out of my life?",
"Hey, Sandi! I was going to set something but I thought I’d just try you? Because it’s kind of urgent.",
"Ha, no, just thinking back on our chat and your pitch … I feel like I was maybe a little hasty.",
"In fact. I actually, wonder if— First time for everything! If I was just – wrong.",
"Well, I actually haven’t talked to them about it yet. But I’m going to bounce it around. See if I can’t persuade them. Because I really think there’s upside there.",
You’re serious?,
We are the company. Our dad’s the—,
Well I guess we’re taking the car?,
"Um, no, okay, so this is interesting? Sandi and Stewy want to meet? Call or meet. Prefer the meet?",
They’re asking if we’ll be back in the city in the next one to two.,
Daughter Sandi.,
They want to do it in person.,
They’re offering to come to us?,
Do we string them along on the board vote? Then hit them with our Pierce pitch? We could do with partners.,
Pretty fucking standard for a board to ask for more?,
I mean do we even go now? Is it kind of worse to go?,
What is this? We’re kinda pushed.,
"Okay, right, not very convenient but do we want to go somewhere?",
Let’s at least—,
"Well I guess, in one way, ‘board pushes back on price’. What’s the big deal?",
Can we think?,
"Uh-huh, all okay?",
Do we even go up?,
I mean we have a lot to discuss?,
"Few weeks’ pain, might just set us up? I mean I do think we overpromised on Pierce.",
"Yeah, Dad screwed us.",
Sounds like it’s all good?,
"So, do we regroup at my place?",
"Sure, and I’m sorry Dad fucked us and we’re late but we need to decide what we’re doing fast?",
Well do we though? They made some pretty compelling arguments?,
What if I want to talk it through?,
"Maybe Dad’s not on it like he used to be? Maybe he’s underplayed his hand and the board’s all hand-fucking-picked Japanese plastic cats, waving it through.",
I really think we three— We just have quite a lot to— We’re kind of in the middle of something?,
"Do I dare the house red? No, I think, a club soda. But a sealed bottle— Nothing from that tainted nozzle.",
Did you see the ‘Heard on the Street’ bit? On what they think the Waystar price will come out at? Sandi shared.,
Sure.,
"Makes you think – what if he’s not on it like he used to be? Pushed around by Matsson, pushed around by Kerry – giving shows to his girlfriend? Maybe she’s leading him around by his cock? Maybe he’s gone full Xanadu. Lions walking around the kitchen. He’s growing his toenails long and shouting at shadows.",
Exactly!,
"It’s not really for you, Con?",
Yes I want to substitute everything you have for someplace else? Is that okay?,
"And not to be dicks, Con, and we’ll be right, right back – but is it cool if we just do a break-out chat – just for like two?",
"Well, he’s not on the board?",
"Delay, just a small delay, everyone wants the deal.",
"I really think we should discuss this in private and then fill Con in? Because, Con, you don’t have a say here, dude, in a – in a technical—",
It’s a play. More money is more money. That’s all there is to it.  –,
"Dad’s – messaging you? Why is Dad messaging you, Rome?",
"Mm, a check-in. Classic Dad. Always checking in. What the fuck, Rome, is this part of an ongoing conversation?",
Wait – so you texted himinitially?,
We’re not communicating with Dad. We had rules.,
I’ve blocked him. You sending one text is basically being in bed with him. That text is a portal to hell.,
You know I’m sorry but I think I might need to see your phone.,
Hm …,
Well … this is – three messages total?,
Well look. I do feel weird about this betrayal.,
You know he advised Tom on divorce? Dad trick – he’s spoken to every pitbull in Manhattan and tied them up. Can you believe it? I’ve gotten Mommed.,
"Oh might he? And he could ever— Could he, could he consider, saying a – not. The thing that, isn’t. A – lie?",
It’s negotiating one-oh-one. Did they not teach you that when you did management training?,
That’s negotiating one-oh-two.,
‘One-twenty dinar.’,
"I get it, conflict is not nice. But we overpromised on Pierce. This gives us the cash to make it right.",
Is this about Dad for you? You’ve still got ‘Dad feelings’.,
"Me too, that’s why we’re not texting Satan.",
Now someone has to humiliate themselves in the Shame Palace.,
You know what? Maybe she’s not right for you? Have you thought about that? This could be good. You’ll meet someone else.,
What the fuck—?,
You mean you want the money?,
Sorry. We’ve got a lot to get through. Packed program of sad bangers.,
‘Love Don’t Live Here Anymore’.,
We don’t want to see him. Our position’s clear.,
We’re not going anywhere.,
"We won’t be needing you, Kerry.",
Reasons we should vote through the sale. No surprises there. Unless you sing it to the tune of ‘Girl from Ipanema’?,
"No shit. We practically had to walk back from Albany. So can we cut the shit, it’s obvious why you’re here.",
"The thing is, Dad – this isn’t personal. This is a business decision. It’s about the money.",
"Oh super, like it used to be?! Maybe we can all go on a summer vacay? Drive down Route 1 in an RV, singing showtunes?",
I guess you’re still in the honeymoon period? Getting your own show on TV?,
Oh has he fucked you on that?,
"Wait, what, apology? We missed that?!",
"I’m sorry, there’s nothing you could say to me now that I would ever believe.",
"Not now, Con. What are you sorry for?",
"Guys, he’s sorry about the helicopter from today. Well I guess that’s the big one, right?",
Amazing! Are you sure you’re not having that seizure.,
Anything else?,
"How about advising Tom on my divorce? That’s above and beyond, that took effort.",
"You don’t know that! You don’t know him!! You don’t know everything. Saying it doesn’t make it true! Everyone just agrees with you and believes you so it becomes true and then you can say, ‘See, what I said was right,’ but that is not how it is!? You’re a human fucking gaslight!",
When was this?,
This is for real? You’re not bullshitting us?,
Since when?,
"Uh-huh, so you’ve had some moles removed? Big fucking whoop.",
Tom’s dad had one. He had it removed in his lunch hour. They’re nothing.,
What a piece of shit.,
By lying about cancer? Best Dad Ever.,
"Yeah I think I can speak for all of us, can I? When I say— go ask him for more money.",
‘It’s what my gut is telling me and I’ve just got to listen to my gut. It’s all I’ve got to go on.’,
So how was it for you? Fucking Dad?,
Fake cancer was pretty special.,
I’m not even going. I’m gonna fart down the phone.,
He’s gonna cancel though isn’t he?,
I’m sure she’ll be in touch.,
"Con, come on. That’s not—",
I think that’s the opposite of what just hap—,
Jesus Christ.,
"Hey. What you heard about Matsson, is the deal going to be okay? You okay?",
I dunno fuck you I’m only asking.,
"I hear Stockholm. Gone, or going.",
You think Matsson’s gonna tell Dad to fuck off?,
"What do we do if it falls apart, Ken? What’s the latest from Nan and Naomi? You in touch with Naomi—",
Okay? You think he might drop by?,
Should we tell him? Someone should tell him. Really?,
… Mum?,
What? What’s happened?,
"What, Ken?",
What do you mean?,
"No. It’s too much. It’s too soon. I can’t have that, it’s too soon.",
Can he hear? Is he still hearing?,
"Um. Hello, Dad? I um, you’re gonna be okay. And – um— I don’t know if he’s dead. Is he fucking dead?",
"Tom, is he alive? Tom! Is he even alive?",
Are you just being nice? Has he gone?,
Oh Jesus.,
"I don’t know. Dad? Don’t go. Dad. Don’t go, Daddy. I love you. Don’t go please. Not now. I love you, Daddy. You fucking, I don’t know. Oh god. Dad. There’s no excuses for – for— But I love you. I do. You fucking — I don’t know. I do love you. It’s okay, Daddy, it’s okay. I love you.",
But— [he’s gone?],
"Has he gone, Tom?",
Oh Jesus fucking Christ.,
Do you have his doctor on the line?,
They couldn’t get his doctor.,
Why didn’t you come get me?,
How long was it happening before— I was right out there.,
"Sure. No, it’s okay. But you got to say things?",
Tom just said Kerry spoke to him quite a bit?,
It’s okay. I don’t mind. I just. I’m sad I guess. —,
"Nothing’s happening, right? You’ll tell us if  happens.",
You want me to?,
Oh I think so. Yeah?,
We’ve got to tell him. Too weird.,
"Hey, Con?",
We should do this privately.,
I’m— Let’s just get you to—,
"Dad’s on an airplane to Sweden, but they’re coming back and we think he died. They think he’s dead.",
Come on. Roman is on the phone to the plane and— [you can try to talk to him if you like.],
Anything?,
Look – let’s get private okay? Let’s get this private.,
We don’t know – Rome?,
He was in the bathroom?,
He was in the airplane toilet? Can we get this straight please what actually happened?,
"I think, Roman, you do have to accept …",
"Right, but you sound delusional, because they said he’s [dead] —",
Rome? C’mon. He’s – you know – they know he’s – dead.,
How did you … You heard already?,
If it was a drill I’d say: hats off to the planning department.,
"Maybe they do eventually, leave him, alone?",
What the fuck— Are we going?,
They’re on the statement?,
"Uh-huh, well it feels fucking presumptuous.  – —",
"Oh, the ? Will nobody think of the poor market!",
It’s true.,
"We can’t think, Gerri. Can we keep it up there for an extra beat while we— Until we can— I don’t know. I’m not ready to— So we have a minute?",
I have a headache.,
"No. No. We can’t get them to stay up there until markets open on Monday. Can you get me an Advil, Hugo? I don’t fucking know. At least, Hugo, can we get back to fucking land, we want to go to him, yeah?",
You can say it. Joke.,
"Yeah, um, I thought I knew, when I saw his face, and I actually, thought it was Dad but I said Mom, I said Mom, right?",
"I was thinking was it Dad. I think I sort of— I think I hoped it was Mom. Oh, man, the fucking shit, the , the fucking – everything. I don’t know if I can do it?",
"Hey, Karolina?",
"Oh you want to choreograph some steps with my dead father? That the dance you like, Tom? I’m sorry.",
"Can you give us five? Before we do anything or speak with Matsson, yeah?",
"Um. So, I can’t do this, really, my head is full of fuzz. I feel sick. I can’t …",
Yeah?,
Yeah. Yeah?,
"It’s okay. We know. It’s okay, Ken. I don’t think anything of it, you can say.",
"We need to be across the statement, Rome. It could be all Frank, Karl, Gerri. And even for overnight I think – whatever the text – the subtext has got to be – Logan Roy is – you know— But Roman Roy, Kendall Roy, Shiv Roy are here?",
Uh-huh. Just until the board can meet.,
Hugo.,
"But don’t worry— President of Domestic, Co-COOs, all the Roys are here. Captaining the ship. Plus the execs. Yeah?",
Hugo?,
"Hi. Thank you. As you know my father, Logan Roy, was pronounced dead on arrival at Teterboro Airport this afternoon. I’d like to thank the press for their respect at this time. You’ll understand I won’t be taking questions. But my brothers and I just want to say Logan Roy built a great, American, family company, and as you know, the board will be convening in the next hours to decide on the leadership of the company going forward. This nation has lost a passionate champion, an American titan. And we have lost a beloved father. Thank you. —",
"You mean, will he be angry if we don’t? Tom. Will you go through it again? Is that okay?",
I’m good. — You know which side your bread’s buttered.,
"I said, you – know – which – side your – bread – is – buttered.",
Hello?,
"Oh. No worries, hey, Sharon.",
"Hi. I’m … I’m fine I mean I’m, it’s …",
Yes sure.,
Okay. Good.,
"Um, nope.",
No of course.,
Great.,
Hi Mom.,
Um? I mean – no further deaths. So.,
Yeah. Yeah it was— Wow.,
Yeah. Yeah. I’m sorry. Um – so. Yeah.,
Yeah. Yeah. I don’t know why I called.,
"I’m okay, I think. Yeah. There’s nothing I can do about it. Listen. Just – hello. And I’ll see you at the … If you’re – coming?",
Death becomes her.,
"I don’t think Marcia’s seen him for seven weeks, his calendar says.",
Uh-huh. I might sue her for making me think of Dad doing phone sex. Nothing?,
Got your homework in early?,
"But listen, Ken, we need to huddle. For some of us it’s a sad day, for others – it’s coronation demolition derby.",
"The board call I think, is – eleven. But you saw, you saw from Hugo the thing about – the by-law, the crisis plan or whatever? They have COO step up?",
But that’s just draft. So I think their thing will be— Well I don’t know what their thing will be? But it’s just a draft so.  –,
"We don’t want this to look like a shit show. Chaos narratives, fratricide narratives, bad narratives.",
Great.,
"So. We’re doing the call together because we’re all allied. Floppy floppy, pally pally. We want the deal, we love the deal, new CEO, whoever that might be. Joke! Will be in touch post-board to talk more?",
He doesn’t want to say hi? Is he still buying the company?,
We’re just huddling on that. We’re a pretty fluid group.,
"You obviously know what happened over here, yesterday.",
"Our father just died, and the election is coming, and— You know how would you feel about a meet in the US or—?",
"Fine well, no we see that.",
Cold motherfuckers.,
I feel sick. Do we have to do this?,
Oh sure. You like the  photo?,
"I have to say, Dad sounds amazing. I’d like to have met Dad.",
Roman’s pre-grieved. He already gave at the office.,
Sounds like you have the best grief guy?,
What did he say actually?,
And they’re mostly five stars.,
"Oooh, man, the ? You need a codebook for this one. Ready? ‘A complicated man’.",
"Right, ‘a sharp reader of the national mood’.",
"Um, ‘very much a man of his era’.",
‘Business genius’.,
‘Didn’t suffer fools gladly’.,
"‘Widely respected’. Um, is that – is it – rumored to have a picture of the director of the CIA using a novelty butt plug? ‘Well connected’.",
Is it underlined? Or is that crossed out?,
I’m not saying anything for or against. But as a matter of fact?,
"Look, underlined, crossed out. Whatever, it’s still the board, legally, who are going to choose, right?",
"Look, I wonder if what with the, the underlining or crossing out, the unknown age, right, if the document, isn’t essentially, it’s moot. It’s impossible to decipher.",
Right.,
He had— What does he have?,
"Fuck it, why not burn them for the insurance?",
I dunno. It’s what he’s wanted his whole fucking … Part of me is like give the poor orphan the thing he wants. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.,
"Well, so long as it is?",
"Yeah. Just. No, I mean, it’s felt good. Us? Right? And does this feel good? Would that— feel good?",
"Yeah, you know. You?",
Worried you picked the wrong horse? Picked the dead horse?,
"My main thing, honestly, I guess has been just slowly coming to accept that we killed him.",
He died on the plane and he wouldn’t have been on the plane except we made him get on there. So that’s just very cool.,
I just don’t want to fake myself out. If we’d just said ‘yes’ to GoJo he might have been around for twenty more years – to rock his grandkids to sleep?,
Sure. Well. I dunno. That’s fucked now too. I’m angry. My dad died. My mom’s a fucking— [disaster.] My husband is – is— And Kerry. Marcia. It feels like I’m the only one who actually lost something they wanted here. And it’s not coming back. So.,
Uh-huh. That was a while ago now.,
He doesn’t know what the fuck to do with himself. Look at his arms.,
What the fuck now?,
"Er, well, I’m not sure about that? I’m not sure I want him here today.",
"Well, they spoke. But – no – it was transactional.",
He hardly knew him!,
I just don’t want to see his smirky little autocratic face.,
"I think I have a veto, my dad just died.",
"Oh, you do? Now you do?",
"Well I would say. I think what has happened is – is, an opportunity to change some things.",
Should we not at least talk about what we’re gonna do with the company for two minutes before we let Mencken up here? And whether our ATN is even gonna be in bed with Mencken. And like a hundred things?,
"Maybe we’re gonna change? Dad’s just died, maybe we should do real news?",
"Well you can. I think they did. Do you turn on ATN, Ken? Rome? Do you watch it? They’re hot for civil war. They’re laying serious track. It’s embarrassing.",
They’re one step from showing fucking road maps to National Guard weapons depots?,
Ugh. I didn’t know we were having a kids’ entertainer.,
I’m sorry but I am going to puke. Can’t we get rid of these old men telling me who my dad was? Jerking off all over his body? Every man with a mustache and a war crime to his name is in here.,
Okay. Incoming.,
"Thank you, Stew.",
Thank you.,
"Plus, still has a board vote?",
"‘Take her out the back, Billy, and don’t make a mess of my trunk’?",
How’s your friend Sandy?,
Uh-huh.,
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. I know. I’m happy to talk.,
Her boat came in didn’t it? This has really turned into the grand tour for her?,
You know Connor’s moving in?,
Uh-huh. You speak to Mom yet?,
You seen this? Hearts – the soccer fans celebrating online. Nasty.,
Con? Do you mind?,
"Okay. Let’s discuss, but stop jonesing, Ken. It’s like you’re walking round the wake with a fucking hard-on, you know?",
"Um, yeah. Okay. Good. But I have thoughts.",
I think it needs to be me too.,
"We’re doing what we do, together.",
His  is the clean broom? You were jerking it over a piece of paper he’d scribbled your name on. There’s an argument you’re the worst of both worlds. Different but the same.,
Uh-huh. And what about me?,
"Oh and I don’t, I look all teary-eyed and mascara-streaked and like I might faint? Fuck you. It’s plenty clean enough.",
I did the Strategic Review.,
Well I need to wet my beak.,
I don’t need to be front-facing. It’s not ego.,
I don’t know. I’d need to be across everything.,
Uh-huh. And that’s all equal?,
"Uh-huh. I mean, you fuck me, that’s – it’s— This is a Dad promise. On yesterday.",
Thanks for coming. Shitting your whack about what we’re going to do to ATN?,
I heard this morning you were going around your plane with a joke – telling people you thought he was dead already?,
Professors. Jews.,
Actually I think he was mostly pissed you didn’t deign to visit on his birthday?,
It went okay.,
Oh yes. Yup.,
Uh-huh. All great. All good. Listen. Richard and Katy have done everything wonderfully. But shall I get Richard to call and we can get this catered? Let the staff take some downtime?,
"Yeah, they’re just servants after all, huh?",
Yeah ha-de-ha. Can you maybe shut the fuck up? This is not a fucking comedy night.,
"Hey, did I miss the invite? What’s the conflab – Boomers and Zoomers?",
"Uh-huh, cos I wanted to stop by anyway. About the nasty Dad stuff? You seen the stories? It feels like it might be sourced from inside?",
Is he wobbling?,
A list? Of— To go?,
Is it real? It feels provocative. Why did he call Frank? What is this?,
Or invite everyone because he doesn’t want just to deal with the B-roll brothers here? Can I see the list? [Am I on the list?],
I thought you were pre-grieved? Dodged the sad bullet. On to the eighth stage of grief – Martinis.,
"C’mon, Rome, he’s gone, so – Colonel Mustard in the library, none of it fucking matters.",
So you two aren’t concerned about the Dad stuff? Cos there’s been more.,
Uh-huh?,
"I guess I’m just struck by the number of pieces which knife Dad and imply his kids, particularly his younger sons, have been covering for him for quite some time?",
Just interesting. How you two look golden?,
"I’m fine. I like watching you guys Mini-Dad it. Like when the Muppets put on a trench coat and act like they’re a real person. I don’t care, if you want to burn Dad’s legacy – but I actually think it would be better, for all of us, to be together. Like not even with an agenda, just to … get through this?",
"Reading documents, is what you’re doing, Ken.",
Uh-huh. How’s he doing?,
"Nice kicks, Tom. So white. Whiter than an ATN Christmas party.",
Why you even here do you think?,
"Uh-huh. And how you feeling. About this knife fight? Excited, to get into it? Stab someone in the back?",
You know they’d fire you right now if I said? They’d like to. Ken and Rome.,
"Jesus Christ. Grow some balls, Tom. It’s gross. You’re good at your job. You’re a great guy. Everyone likes you. Didn’t you know?",
"Hey, Queefer Sutherland. You should be nervous. Early voting sounds lovely and bad for your boy Jeryd.",
Oooh. Iceman.,
"You’re good, Ken. Fucking, every dollar you squeeze makes us stronger when we do Pierce-ATN. Right?",
‘Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.’,
"Con, we appreciate you holding this down. What do you need from us?",
Maybe we shouldn’t have left him with Con. He’d be angry we left him.,
"Haha, yeah, sorry. Glad it’s awkward machismo here too, was afraid you might wear a papoose and respect me.",
Fuck him. It’s dude-bluff.,
"Um, so, I just got a bad rumor in my ears.",
ATN’s been leaving an open line to Jeryd’s campaign team during morning editorial conference. Dialed in. Did you know that?,
"Rome? That comes out, any credibility is blown.",
"The numbers I hear, he’s not gonna win.",
Rome? Jesus. Even Dad had a line.,
"Yes. Well. Fuck it, why not. It’s a toxic asset.",
We could just keep one of his old sweaters. Less racist?,
Yeah but I’m not sure whoever owns it can afford to change it. It’s weapons dealing. The margins are too good.,
And if he doesn’t move? If he walks?,
Uh-huh? But can we? Do we?,
In the last twenty-four hours?,
"Well, the market likes that you’re selling?",
"Sure, and he wanted to poison Brezhnev and hang Mandela. He wasn’t always right. But overall – I think what he wanted really was the deal. So—",
Well yes I am aware he is not here because I have a hole in my heart and a forty-eight-hour migraine and I don’t know whether to shit or cry thank you.,
"I honestly, I don’t even fucking care. I don’t. Let’s get it done. Let’s just get it fucking done.",
"You spend much time in the Congo, Lukas?",
We okay?,
"What, the majestic stags? Sparring with their memory-foam hard-ons? Breathtaking spectacle.",
Sure. So straightforward. I’m sure.,
"Then I would say: that makes sense, why not tell them?",
Oh really? So what I’m the messenger girl?,
Yeah. Well. They misheard somebody say something a long time ago and got strung out on a dream.,
Owsh! They can be guys without being  guy.,
Is it potentially there. Potentially.,
Ugh. Trying to make decisions about how my fucking dad is buried.,
"Yes, Lukas, in the ground. Jesus Christ. Unless you want to mount him on your wall, since you fucking killed him?",
Uh-huh.,
Look. I think a bump gets you over the line.,
I guess. Why the fuck not?,
"Um, I dunno.",
Yeah she’s good. She’s solid.,
Yeah?,
Yeah. It’s not nice having a helicopter land on you.,
"Um. We’re fucked. It’s a disaster. I broke his heart, he broke mine. Lost our footing. I dunno.",
Uh-huh.,
Okay.,
"Right. Yeah, not great?",
"Half a liter? Okay, well, first of all, ‘good one’, obviously.",
Right.,
"No, but this is— Who is this?",
Naturally. Sounds like she’s got more of your blood than you do?,
"Deniability is hard, with her having so much of your blood. Your own head of comms? Man! Yeah look, I don’t know who you’ve got advising you – but I would say, however bad they’re telling you this is, you need to 10X it. People don’t know you. If this acquisition goes through, US media is going to be all over you. And if you’re the creepy stalker who writes code in the dark dripping into an IV bag, and harassing his direct reports, that has an economic impact.",
"So three-point PR plan, off the top of my head. Point one. Stop sending people your blood.",
Catch and kill maybe? Or just a very open meeting. Do  fire her. Gerri would be good on this. I can give you some informal advice if you like.,
Yeah?,
Jesus. I’d heard it was bad but this is – baggy as fuck. Grueling. Is this smart?,
Hey. Seen the nasty little gossip piece about out here? No one’s getting on? Bad vibes. Where’s this come from?,
Uh-huh.,
Jealous? Just working the case. Looking for our angles.,
"Honestly, nah, I think he wants ATN for real. So he might go high.",
Uh-huh. Good. GERRI/FRANK/KARL Good.,
"You know, you should be careful, Tom. People are coming down from molly. Their pupils are dilated. Your sneakers are like looking at the sun. They’re dangerous.",
"I’m helping. This is why no one takes you seriously, Tom. Your shoes are too white.",
Hey! What the fuck?,
You look like a kindergartner on the first day of school.,
"Looks like there’s a deal, Matsson takes ATN. Whole caboodle.",
"It’s okay to be happy, Tom. The Great Escape!",
"Anyway, we think it’s time for some moves at ATN. I’m not happy.",
"Cyd’s getting too close with Mencken, little bit power-crazed post-Dad. She’s gotta go.",
Uh-huh. You wanna let her know?,
"Don’t get an erection, Tom, it’s weird. Wanna get dinner when we get back?",
Excuse me. Important.,
Hey.,
So what?,
"Ouch, that hurts. Don’t criticize my jet interior! So?",
Well I’m sure we’re keeping you fully informed through the proper channels.,
"It is on the calendar. If we cancelled a product launch, it’d look like we were just minding the store till you come in.",
Living Plus.,
"According to our market research, people respond. People are weird.",
Well that’s presumptuous.,
I was trying to keep us on track. —,
Exciting. Sort of executive museum guide?,
Such as?,
"Something ‘amazing’? Ooooh! You hooked me, reel me in!",
Uh-huh?,
Maybe I hate you?,
Maybe I’m intuitive. Maybe I just know. Maybe I love my brothers very much.,
Sure.,
Look. You spoke. I listened. But I should go. I think my flight’s about to leave. Start the engines!,
"Fuck you, my boy on the outside. I’m going to tell my brothers everything you said.",
What is this?,
What e happened?,
And so what are you suggesting?,
Uh-huh? Yeah?,
Oh .,
Do you think I’m dumb?,
I know you.,
I fucking know you!,
‘What?’,
"You’re not very good at this, boys. Are you? I know you! I fucking know you! ‘Dad, Shiv spilt chocolate milk in the Range Rover.’ You’re trying to fuck the deal.",
"Oh yeah? But you never mentioned this, this quite fucking interesting incident? Even as a bit of gossip? Go on, lie to me, lie to my face. —",
"Oh, thanks, guys, don’t get mud on my confirmation dress! Thanks so fucking much!",
"Oh okay? Here’s the invite, lost in the mail for a while, but here it is?",
"The idea was, we were getting out, clean, doing Pierce, buying Pierce, together. What happened?",
Shivvy cheering from the stands?,
You cocksuckers. I have a lot of options.,
Well. You better be. I could fuck you up.,
Are we all set up?,
I’m fine.,
We booked this room.,
"I am very busy and I – I am too busy and what with my dad— I sometimes get Sarah to book me somewhere, to have a moment – to cry. Fuck you.",
Yeah well. I’m organized. Fuck off.,
Okay?,
So what the heck was that?,
"Hey. So, am I cramping your style? You wanna ‘get amongst it’?",
The vaginas of the cheerful women who aren’t tall enough to be models?,
"So, who do you like? What would be your first … port of call? Shall I guess?",
Or. I’ll choose. You think you could seduce someone here? Is that what you’ve been doing? Going up and saying things and being all … ‘hey’.,
You’re sorry?,
"Oh, you should be so lucky! You didn’t even scratch the surface. I was fucked long before I met you.",
"TK, the Washington situation. You were the one after The One and that’s always hard.",
Hardly a scratch. Whereas I’m the whole story for you right? I’m the one who twisted your heart up?,
Mary! Tom. I did a number on you. ‘Mary’?! C’mon. You hadn’t had a taste of the dark meat till you met me.,
Wanna play Bitey?,
"Bitey. We never played Bitey? You bite me, I bite you, see who can take it?",
"Okay? If you stop, the other stops. And you lose. Ready?",
Exactly. One two three: Bitey.,
Uh-huh?,
Is that all you’ve got?,
Aghh. Motherfucker!,
Nice.,
"Let me ask you one thing. You’re all in for Matsson, right?",
My thing is. I don’t totally know what to do.,
Well we have a connection.,
What? Just – not like that. You think because you want to suck him off I want to fuck him? You think we’re all gonna fuck each other and end up living in a big Matsson house singing Matsson songs?,
Ooooh. Truth bombs from the phony man.,
Well maybe you shouldn’t have betrayed me? Ah? Phony?,
Privacy?,
"Hey, Lukas. Hey, Swedey.",
Um. So I thought maybe I should mention. We’re going to push Living Plus.,
No. Like how?,
What you think of the words?,
And the numbers? I mean I get the idea. But. Whoa. Big numbers. I’m worried. He’s got that gleam in his eye.,
Yeah? Doing his speech from his ramshackle playhouse? And have you heard about Dad?,
Did you fire Gerri and Joy?,
This is not good. Rome. But you can save this. He’s out of control. You’re out of control. This is going down. Shall we pull the plug on today?,
"Made-up numbers, shooting to the moon? Fake Dad and imaginary clouds. Dude?",
He could do anything up there. And then you’re part of it?,
How’s he doing?,
Oh my fucking god.,
Oh my god I want to die. He’s dying and I want to die and Dad’s dead. Everything’s dead!,
I actually don’t know if I can watch this.,
"Keep it light, Ken. Special speaker from beyond the fucking grave!",
An idea he couldn’t exactly remember the name of.,
"Now renamed, ‘Kendall Goes Woo-Woo’.",
Okay. Leaving planet earth. Glad you’re not strapped in?,
"Is this flying, Karolina, is it— What we getting?",
"No, you don’t want to run prison camps for grandmas.",
Hm? Okay. Yes. Holocaust joke.,
"Well done, Ken. Knew you’d do it.",
"Heil, Kendall!",
"I think, one thing, if we’re thinking of hosting, I can’t get into all our shit, okay? I think – if it’s okay by you, we do strictly party and strategy shit?",
Hey – Tom?,
Yeah Jiménez up four? How will you play?,
Matsson.,
"Don’t worry, only to marry me and have a dozen Aryan children with me and then we all sing in a choir together—? Thinks the Living Plus stock bump is fading, wants to know what else my bros have cooking?",
To the party? No.,
He doesn’t want to ‘swim around my dad’s bullshit pre-election brain-dead AOL-era legacy-media putrid stuffed-mushroom fuckfest’.,
"Oh, man. How did I get to be his inside bitch?",
"Maybe. It was just nice, when it was nice with my brothers and — I dunno? That was nice.",
"Shoot me, but – I like getting on with my family.",
I know and I like that. But I’d like to live in the light? Did you make?,
"Yeah, right, that’s good and— Oh. Okay?",
"It’s a— What is it, it’s a – a scorpion?",
Right? A scorpion. Because—?,
Because?,
Who’s the scorpion?,
Okay? Right.,
"Right. Okay. Yeah. I like it, heh. Get to work! Go contribute to the great toxification!",
"Hey, how you doing?",
"And what, any – change?",
Here he is. Kendall Plus. The man who led us to eternal life. Waystar Jesus.,
You all seen the polling?,
Just – on Marcia I think I am content to exclude consideration of her wishes entirely?,
"The beatings, betrayals and psychological tortures? I’m kidding. I’m gonna do cozy shit. His famous lobster rolls. His ranked lists of the laziest ethnicities.",
"What, before every powerful political, cultural and business interest in the world?",
"I think if any one of us  to do the big number – we should say? Because no one probably minds, right?",
"Um, yeah on the party? Tom is very – concerned about being fresh for the election and—",
"I know you’re looking forward, Con. I just— I’d like us to be respectful, of Tom.",
"Nate Sofrelli?! Um, well, me and Tom are— We were hoping it would be kind of— Why?",
We need a plan B if we can’t chase him out of town on price?,
Okay? Since when did— [you two discuss this?],
Hmm?,
Due process? Sure. It’s just quite – complicated.,
"What about Gerri? Gerri might be useful on this, cos she handled all—?",
You what? You  Gerri?,
"Oh, sure, that’s the thing about Gerri – dumb.",
My godmother?,
Wakey wakey. You okay?,
Haha. Yeah so listen couple extra for the guest list. Matsson is in fact coming.,
"Well, because Dumb and Dumber are going to try to stop the deal with regulatory shit, so he’s coming to head that off.",
"Exactly. And so, to push that agenda, they wanted to invite, and I didn’t feel, tactically I could say ‘no’, to invite Nate. He’s key on tech and trade. So. If that’s okay?",
Yeah. So sorry if— Yeah? I am sorry. Really.,
"I can— If you want? I can just say, no, ‘you went ballistic’? I feel gross about this. I feel like an asshole.",
Okay! Let’s get those surveillance capitalism heebie-jeebies cooking. Don’t let me get stuck with the  op-ed ogres.,
Seriously. Right?,
Do we just throw him out?,
How do we play?,
Uh-huh?,
"Nate, Carly, and Valerie first. I’ll keep eyes on my brothers. And Lukas, I’m sure you’ve done this before but – don’t, like don’t—",
"Well, you’re about to purchase some of the most prized cultural assets and political communication channels in America and you need to prepare the ground or your many enemies will portray you as some heartless jerk-off coder from Gothenburg.",
Of course. How are you?,
"This is for later, Ebba. I wonder if you shouldn’t fire your lobbyists?",
He’s amenable.,
He’s gonna do a Great Replacement.,
"Hey, Carly. You’ve met Lukas?",
Nice wordings. Eminently plausible.,
"No, you’re doing great. We’ve hit the A-Team. Now we maybe build your profile with some op-ed narcissists, and Beltway psychos?",
Oh yeah. It’s only money and gossip.,
"Sure. I guess my only question at that point would be: great, I love heaving you around like a great lump of pine and making you shine. But. What have you done for me lately?",
"This situation is not without risk. So if I was to move to actively engage in assisting you in the acquisition, I would need to know it leads to a very very very significant role.",
Yeah.,
"I know my way around the company. I know everything. I’m collaborative and I have the name and I just— I’m hot shit and I’m ready to go. So? You don’t want to be across all the bullshit, you want to be coding and strategizing in the clouds. So do we just say it’s me running shit day to day?",
No.,
You don’t have to worry about Mr Mild here. I assure you he’s a one-pepper menu item.,
Did we mention he’s very tired? Poor guy can’t be across everything. Maybe you should call Pam on that? Everyone here’s needling me.,
"I get it, Tom. But – there was— Did you hear in Phoenix the O’Malleys firebombed a campaign office?",
What? Did you hear about Phoenix?,
What. What are you talking about?,
"I mean, that’s— Wow! And, you’re sure? Is it big enough to be significant?",
So. What is going on with the numbers?,
‘What numbers’?,
Uh-huh.,
What does ‘a little bit bullshit’ mean?,
You discovered—?,
"Stock and cash deal, the board would be within their rights to pull out. When— How are you handling? When are you addressing?",
It’s gonna get out eventually.,
I want to rewind. SEC? DOJ? Is this even legal? How hot is it in hell?,
You guys okay?,
Okay?,
Well maybe we can just see folks off together?,
"You’re not gonna be doing anything, Tom. You’ll be watching for shiny foreheads. Just forty-five more minutes.",
Uh-huh. Sorry. I’m just— I’m worried. I’ve nailed myself to the Matsson cross but he might be bullshit. He’s – erratic and I’m not sure he’s real.,
"Right, you’re Tinker Bell for Matsson? There’s a time-bomb in his numbers and I might get blown up.",
Well no. I’m fucking my family for this!,
"It was implied, a little, lightly, just as part of – a tactical kind of – like a joke, just a little—",
"It’s something he said, a thing that isn’t true, but we needed to say it.",
I’m not doing this now. I’m in serious trouble. That was a play.,
Well. You’re projecting. Because that is actually you.,
With a scorpion? No.,
"Yeah. I know. I’m a scorpion. You’re a hyena, a street rat. ‘Haha’. What’s not funny? You’re a snake. Here’s a dead snake to wear as a necktie, why aren’t you laughing, Tom?",
"Well, sure.",
"You proposed to me at my lowest fucking ebb, my dad was dying. What was I supposed to say?",
I didn’t want to hurt your feelings.,
Tsch. Hick. You’re a hick.,
"You were only with me to get to power. So. You got it, Tom. You got it.",
I don’t think so. You were fucking my DNA. You were fucking a ladder because you and your family are striving and parochial.,
Your mom loves me more than she loves you. She’s cracked. You betrayed me.,
You offered to go to jail because you’re servile. You’re servile.,
"Did you read that in a book, Tom?",
"You’re pathetic, you’re a masochist who can’t even take it.",
"Well that is not a very nice thing to say is it, Tom?",
And because of you I missed the last six months with my father —,
You sucked up to him and cut me out.,
Sure I don’t like you. I don’t even care. I don’t care about you. Feel good now? Yeah? Feel good? Glad we cleared the air?,
Jesus. Why did you let me marry him?,
Okay! C’mon. Wine! Music! Fun!,
Yeah. Oh yeah. Fun party.,
Tom? Oh we love it. We love to fuck in the car we keep crashing. Burton and Taylor being chauffeured by Grace Kelly.,
Well. That’s the job. That’s some of the job.,
The top thing?,
It is not.,
"We keep me in the box for now, I don’t want a mess with my family. But once we’re closed— I’d like to move forward without Tom. It’s too tricky for me.",
Fuck Tom.,
"Knock yourself out, Rome, paint it red.",
I got four smileys from Gil. They think they’ve got it.,
Well four smileys is more than two eggplants?,
Eggplant eggplant flag reeks of the misogynistic bravado which has so repelled the median voter. I feel sick.,
"What you hearing seriously, these your Nazi vans?",
"In Florida they picked people up, told them they were taking them to vote and a kid got left by a highway, it’s fucking kidnapping.",
"Hey, Lukas. Looking like Jiménez. So. Good for democracy. Great for us.",
"But I think either way, we think about, your funky numbers, tomorrow, day after, get ahead of the numbers, I’ll come up with some language—",
You talked to  about this?,
"Upstairs. We leave that to them, you know Dad’s rule?",
Who watches the watchmen? I fucking do! Are you getting good numbers.,
Okay.,
Electrical failure?,
Not what Nate hears.,
"Oh do you? What about the actual pictures, of it happening I can get on my fucking phone?",
By not telling them anything they don’t want to hear?,
"If it’s Milwaukee, if it was deliberate, it’s Menckenists.",
Oh shut up.,
Are the ballots intact? —,
Hey. What’s going on?,
"Hello, Tom.",
Are the ballots still in there?,
"Um. Listen, just fast I wanted to just to apologize, for some of the things that I said, at the party?",
And give you a chance. Also to— [You might want to retract some of what you said.],
"Well, look, I can’t do it to— that.",
"No. Jesus fucking Christ. Tom, my father has just died. My father just died, okay? And for  I have been a little, off-kilter. Maybe I can get some margin of consideration on that?",
What does that mean? ‘Sure’.,
I did not hate him. I loved him.,
"Fucking hell, man.",
"Yeah that’s the bit I’ll remember. Thanks. Yeah, well, also. I am pregnant, by you. And there is never a good time to say but eventually you need to know so, okay? Now you know.",
You— What?,
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yup. Yeah. I mean. I think obviously everyone knows. But I wanted to acknowledge that things are tough. With my situation and Tom. I want to get into it but I can’t get into it now okay?,
"I think. Maybe he’s just a piece of filth and – there’s— I need to fill you in on stuff. But – you can’t trust him. You know that, right?",
"So, under state law, the vote is not certified until absentee ballots are counted. No Wisconsin result is valid until the absentee ballots are counted.",
"Confident but terrified. Yeah. Is that a— I don’t know if there’s a name for that feeling? So, Rome, under Wisconsin law …",
Well no. Like a hundred thousand absentee Milwaukee ballots are missing. So we have to figure out how to go forward and—,
Artificial lead. With a hundred thousand Milwaukee ballots missing? Every vote must be counted.,
‘Some have been lost’? Meaning fascist fuckheads burnt them.,
You are making hay from political violence.,
You don’t believe that.,
"Jiménez is going to take like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona so I don’t even know why you’re even getting uppity about this shit.",
Because – because if Mencken wins it’s the end of the world and so I’d like a little fucking cushion.,
"Who knows, maybe he would. But we cannot let that be the— That’s not the thing here, right, Ken?",
Ken? Don’t get cynical.,
Says the man who cuts his son’s throat to eat him on the high pass.,
No!,
I think they’ll have to hold it again. A revote?,
Well we do know. That in past elections Milwaukee votes would go—,
We do know.,
Rome?,
Bullshit. Bullshit bullshit.,
What?,
We’re saying historically …,
"Look. We know, we just know the fire will have destroyed a lot of Jiménez ballots. Right?",
We just know.,
Where are you going?,
Ken?,
"If the lost votes were counted, Jiménez would take the state.",
"Fucking bullshit! Bullshit! Roman. Fuck you. This is not okay. We need to even this up, we need an opposing viewpoint on this—",
Yeah. Pretty scary.,
"I can handle, I can handle, Lukas.",
"Hey, um so. I just wanted to— It’s so busy but I just wanted to check in.",
"Did you have a good time last night, with Lukas?",
"Do you find me attractive, Gregory?",
I thought you were a ‘Disgusting Brother’? That a little too disgusting for you?,
"Because, I am just letting you know, if you try to fuck me, I’ll kill you.",
What the fuck are you doing to him?,
"He can’t call, Roman!",
"We’re fucked. We’re fucked, Ken. Because we called – it’s fucked.",
I think we— Can we recant? He’s a bad bad man.,
He  he will.,
Maybe. Yeah. Yeah?,
It feels dark.,
Right. But – yeah?,
I dunno. I hate him but. It’s complicated.,
I guess?,
Uh-huh?,
Uh-huh. Sure.,
Uh-huh?,
I appreciate that.,
Right.,
Yeah and also – you’re a – good guy.,
You are. Essentially.,
Uh-huh.,
"I – er, I, guess I would say, that whatever the advantage for us, as as, corporate players short-term in such a move, he’s – he’s the nightmare. Plausible in – a – a – a decadent era. You know, the whole what we have is— People think it’s a thick wall they can just throw endless rocks at to register their general disapproval. And the edifice, people hate will just – just stand. But you know, things break, it’s not a wall, it’s perishable – vegetation. People have no idea,  how bad things could get.",
He says the bad shit. He believes the bad shit. He’s a— Yeah. What can I say?,
"We might not be able to crown him, but we can stop him. He gets momentum tonight, that makes it possible. He needs our call.",
You’re okay. You’ve tried. It’s all we can do.,
"Nah, man. Nah. And I think even Dad wouldn’t back him tonight.",
"Sure but – an early call? It’s bad business. We throw the papers and the whole thing in for him? And then the courts go the other way in a week, a month, and we’re essentially done as a news organization?",
Yeah. I think there’s something there.,
I— They might be— They are willing to think.,
They’re just not – so. Direct? I think we can probably get them to stop it.,
Roman. Even Dad – even Dad – in this situation would respect —,
"He liked stability, he pushed and— But he never wanted shit to unravel. He helped end, he ended wars.",
"Um, he would talk and – and they could see the arguments. It was encouraging. What are you—?",
Don’t call him.,
They’re – busy.,
Bad faith. Bad-faith argument.,
Oh now China is coming?,
What?,
I found it hard to get Nate so I summarized some impressions.,
"No. We all— We agreed I would get close to him, to help—",
No. No. I – I – I— (just got close to him and then you two—),
"No. I have some options – and, did exactly what we said. I was getting cut out, so—",
No.,
"Look. I – I have fostered a relationship. I have but, you – said yourself, you said yourself, you’ve thought—",
"Please, listen, aside – from all this, aside, it’s not the right thing —",
Ken? Please. C’mon. Who are we?,
I am not going to let this happen. There comes a time—,
"Seriously, this is real. My concern for the state of – the Republic and – pluralism and the future – is—",
Fuck you. Ken?,
I don’t have a pass for in here?,
"I might go public. I might go to the papers, to people with what you’re doing.",
Fuck you. This is about the future of the Republic.,
You prick.,
"No, Tom. No. This is a terrible mistake.",
Fucking – Pontius Pilate!,
You’ve done something bad here.,
Things do happen.,
"It’s more than fucking crazy, Lukas.",
We are going to do a number on them. We are going to fuck them so hard. We’re gonna fix this. Yeah?,
No. But – this is out of control.,
"Nah. That’s not the play. No, let’s take his legs out before he can goose-step his way up Fifth. Episode Nine",
"Uh-huh. So, I think you need to get your bad numbers out. Because this is just an amazing day to bury bad news. It’s a freebie. And who knows how long this will last?",
A tsunami just washed everything away. No one’s checking the dicks. Seriously. I know this. Do it.,
I don’t see it. I think the courts stop him. He’s just – he’s out of tune with like some deep – sentiments of this country and—?,
"Well no, no, not—",
"Yeah, but—",
"Cleanest is just stopping him? Activate, donate, motivate. Can you talk to – your – to your buddies. Get the algos pushing the straight dope? Look. I gotta go. I’ll see you there. He’ll be there. Okay. Lot of angles. You gonna tell Ebba to bury those numbers. It’s just so golden.",
Hey.,
Are you really gonna do that shit today?,
"Oh you have strong feelings? Look what you’ve done to the world, you’ve set it on fire!  have strong feelings??",
"Uh-huh. And is he coming, Mencken?",
You do.,
You okay?,
"I’m sorry, Ken.",
Oh now Mom suddenly wants to play mom? Fuck off.,
"So, also. I’ve been wanting to tell you. And I’m likely telling Mom today, so, I may as well say, I’m actually pregnant.",
"Uh-huh, haha.",
It’s Tom’s. Like four months. So.,
"Great, yeah, good stuff.",
"Jesus fucking Christ, man.",
No. My kid will kill you. I’ll train my kid to kill.,
Uh-huh. Sure.,
Sure.,
"Well, it is not a new administration.",
"God, you really have ruined Dad’s funeral.",
Spoken with the gravitas of a man who gave a blowjob to become ambassador to Slovenia. Sorry.,
"But we agreed Roman would do the eulogy, Con?",
"Sure. I’m just worried – this is, it’s so long. And also actually hard to follow?",
The middle is very vindictive? Overall it just reads as something of a – of a bitter screed?,
I worry your eulogy could leave us open to legal action?,
"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I was going to say. I was about to say.",
Thanks. Yeah. Can’t really understand it. But yeah. My spite baby. I’m thinking of getting in-utero plastic surgery. So it comes out only looking like me.,
Is he okay?,
"Why not. Network heaven. Whole board, half the Senate, quarter of the House?",
Not everything is connected.,
He’s on top of the world. Target-rich environment. Buttering up the butterballs.,
You’re tied to two dirty little fuckers. You know he’s having therapy?,
"Apparently. Who knows what dirt he did for Dad, ah? We should put the shrink on the payroll. Want to touch base with Lukas?",
Okay. Here we go. Mommy dearest. Are we freezing her out?,
Sure. It’s her big day. Don’t want to rain on her parade? Hi. Hello.,
Yup.,
Yes.,
I know.,
Yup.,
Thank you.,
Well I have to be careful giving you information. You might use it against me?,
Thank you.,
How respectful.,
About Dad?,
No. Absolutely not. Hey. Thanks for coming.,
And I want to say. I am sorry – how things have worked out.,
"So, the numbers pieces starting to come out. No significant blowback, right?",
It might get worked into this profile on you. The writer made contact for a phoner but I’m thinking—,
Well. Obviously the whole thing is unimaginable. But. I did have one idea. If he comes through. Mencken?,
"I guess, rather than walk away. Would it be smart to see if—?",
"Well, you’ve toyed— What about, what about, you offer him a US CEO for the US properties at least? Give him a win on that, let him have that as a media win?",
Oh I dunno. .,
You know who could be good?,
Um. Shiv Roy?,
"Well, political acumen, knows the world. Can cut a deal and delegate. Just very fucking clear-sighted. Plus, apparently she’s got the chairman that sad Swede basically pulling her strings anyway?",
"Uh-huh. She’s Lukas Matsson’s total puppet, they say.",
Yeah. But she’s one of these hard bitches who’s probably gonna do like thirty-six hours’ maternity leave. Emailing through her vanity Cesarean. Poor kid will never see her.,
I know. Not widely liked. Highly effective. Not well-liked.,
"Well maybe, maybe there’s a heart under there somewhere. Who knows?",
I can do anything. My dad’s dead.,
Lot of news today. In the grindhouse.,
What to?,
I think you might not be on the program here?,
What do we—? Can you—?,
Yeah? Go on. Yeah. That’s not it all. What Ewan said—,
Are you serious? It’s an off-the-shelf mausoleum.,
Catfood Ozymandias.,
Good deal.,
Chance to get to know him?,
I’m intrigued to see how he gets out of this one?,
Probably got MeToo’d.,
Well what is it? A shopping list? Forty-eight things to see in purgatory?,
Well can someone get it out?,
I know. Jesus. I guess he got away with it?,
"Dad, he didn’t ever – really. What was the worst. How bad was Dad?",
Yeah?,
You okay?,
Uh-huh. Okay. Wanna come watch me scuba in his bullshit.,
"Mr President, follow me. I’m your extraction team. These people may bore the very life from your body.",
Can I invite over Mr Matsson?,
"Well my thing would be, you’re done talking to your side, chance now to open out. Big-tent this shit?",
Quiet the rhetoric though. The country has a headache.,
Here we go.,
Anarchocapitalist parmigiana.,
"So – I guess what we want to think about is what would make you, assuming, you make it, what could reassure you about his ownership?",
My dad had deep ocean currents swirling his gut. But on specifics? He liked winning. Money. And gossip. That was about it when you got down to it.,
I do. But Dad was flexible. I’m flexible. I get how things go.,
You made it.,
Ballsy. Whole new Tom. You’d never have dared not come to his funeral when he was alive.,
Well I know it’s fine.,
"I wasn’t sure I wanted to keep it, then I wasn’t sure it was – okay. But it is, by all accounts, so.",
It seemed too sad. Then we had a bit of a honeymoon and I dunno?,
"Oh I’m hardly going to see it, the family way.",
They don’t grow up emotionally stunted?,
"Can we talk actually, Mum. About – plans? If there’s – an air- clear – you might help me with? I’ll text you.",
"Meh, you disassociate fairly early.",
You’re exhausted. Why don’t you go back to the apartment? Just for a few hours. I don’t care. Sleep. The blinds are working.,
"You can. You were going to be here, now you’re going to be there. This is going to go on for months.",
"Just hide for a while. † Hey? So. This fucking  guy. Still texting at my dad’s funeral, you really have to respect the disrespect.",
Yes?,
"From, yeah? Okay. Good. Smart!",
Okay? Let’s make a meatball burger!,
Okay! I think they lost Stewy! He’s wonked. I think – we have Ken in the trunk. We have him trussed up and ready to fucking bake!,
You worried?,
"Cos we got me, obviously. Simon, Frank. Sandy and Sandi locked. I think Stewy’s not gonna split. He says all sorts of shit but: money, honey. Diane Liu, Sonya? We’re there. With margin. We peel off Ewan, Paul, Dewi? It could, end up being just fucking Ken. And Rome against. If Roman even shows up from whatever jerk dungeon he’s getting pity-spanked in? Happy? Yeah?",
"Well sure. That’s me. I love fuck-fuck. You do stuff. So. My list is: you looked at the revised draft announcement Karl sent? That’s all good. I’m checking in with Frank if you wanna do the old-school signing still? Ebba? At Waystar? Them and you – and me, US CEO? What’s yours? Wanna talk Tom? I know you’re thinking about ATN? And it’s not a big deal for me.",
"I know, he’s shitting it!",
"Lukas, sorry. That has to be you. But, okay, he’s a, you know— He’s a very competent guy but, with no, agenda, I think, if it’s simpler to kill him, if he irks you, or – it’s complicated, it  okay. He’s very plausible corporate matter, but also a highly modular interchangeable part. And I would say that to his face.",
"But. If we, with all the changes, you like continuity? Well, ATN is going gangbusters, and he’s well-liked, he’s an insinuating worm. If he stayed on, for me, that also would not be a problem, okay?",
"Tom is – separate from my feelings – Tom will, honestly, suck the biggest dick in the room. That’s my assessment.",
Uh-huh? I’m fine. Good thanks.,
Well it would be lovely. But I just think. Schedules. You know? Board.,
That okay? The profile bullshit?,
"Great, because [I could look into]—",
Sure.,
"Uh-huh. Listen. So – that was – an associate, indicating they have a fix on Roman.",
"I think we’re all, set here? And you have— You’re all diary-ed out on internals for the rest of today so— [there’s nothing for me to do.] I wonder if I do go nail Roman too?",
"Sure, but just if we could get unanimity on the board, or close, all smiling in public? Just for the start of our – reign – it would be so nice?",
"For the corporate narrative? Like if we’re on separate sides, me and the bros, it’s ? Media loves that shit. It would just be so nice, if it was a really clean start. Abundance of caution?",
Roman’s at my mom’s. I’m on my way to bag him. I’m looking for unanimity.,
I’m trying.,
Tom. Can we have a real conversation?,
Look. I don’t know about Matsson. I’ll do what I can. But with us. I wanted to get a few things straight.,
"So, for you, there’s not anything – left?",
I guess I thought it was worth raising— Are there any positives about – the nightmare we’ve shared?,
One way of looking at it – we sort of killed each other. But also we’ve had a – a controlled burn. And that can be healthy?,
"I know. But I guess if there was anything there. It would just be so, very convenient.",
Think of the scheduling?!,
"And also, I guess I would— Like, I’d love to be able to – to not —",
"Hey hey! Hello, Blimey. You okay?",
"Shit, man, what did you—",
"Well, listen, I think it’s good you’re here. Good to rest up.",
"Eyes? Like we all have, human eyes?",
Hey. Easy. Easy. He’s – fragile.,
"Back off, man.",
"No, what?",
"To be fair, Ken and I have different attitudes, but it is a very important one.",
"I’d love to stay. You probably have people to call, right? Busy, losing?",
My folks are actually in the Red Chalet.,
Uh-huh. Well. You know?,
Even if he’s telling the truth. And you get Rome. Seven plays six. I’m not sweating.,
"Here’s one thing I did think. Guys, just to spitball. When it goes through. For you two. The Hundred, remember how hot you were for that and could I [relinquish my part of the IP and]—",
"Rome. Yeah. I’m trying to be realistic, about nice shapes, for when I’m in there. I want you two to— I would love to have you two support me actually?",
"What? Just cos I’m moving forward, my kid loses access to its uncles?? To all the – horrible sexist and homophobic jokes you know.",
I don’t know what to say. You two grabbed the crown. Dad died and you grabbed the crown and pushed me out. So I don’t know why I’m the cunt here?,
"Amazing. Cicero on the wheels of steel. Fuck off. Okay? I won. Sorry for winning. Sorry sorry. I’m tired of being sorry. I just fucking worked it better, so why don’t you take it like a man, ah? And just fucking eat it?",
Surprise surprise.,
"Well, actually to follow through on Dad’s last plans and wishes.",
Drug addict. Sex freak. Emotional war crime.,
"Don’t say you love us, Rome will try to hump you.",
"Well. If she thinks we should sell – in some ways, in a way there is a continuity.",
"Amazing. Hi, Jonathan!",
What?,
Bullshit.,
Oh yeah you’re fucking sorry. Bullshit.,
Already calling.,
Fucking  shit.,
No. He rarely picks up. So. This is so fucking pathetic.,
Fuck off. It’s not right.,
"It’s not right, necessarily. I think someone’s not straight here.",
"Oh don’t come the nice guy. Don’t come the fucking nice guy, Ken!",
Okay. So. What are we going to do?,
I don’t want to talk to him. I don’t want to – I don’t want to— Don’t look at me.,
No you’re not shut the fuck up.,
Not fucking Laird. And not Tellis. I detest Tellis. Tellis is the fucking worst. Call Tellis. We obviously need a read. Call Tellis. He’s not getting even a fucking tiny piece of this.,
This is ugly. This is fucking bad.,
I think you’re chasing rainbows. I think he has it sewn up.,
"Fuck you, Tellis.",
"Uh-huh. Cut to the chase, blondie.",
"Shaky, maybe.",
And what about leadership?,
And like could a combination at the top or a – trio or troika or – a – combination or—,
Everyone.,
There’s a few ways through this.,
I would like to kill him.,
That’s persuasive. What else did he say when no one was around?,
"Sure I mean. Wait, Dad’s calling me now? Princess Di? You shouldn’t be on this line! Is my dad there? Dad, we’re getting a big order from Shake Shack, what you want?",
"He offered it to me too, Rome.",
No. He shouldn’t have said that.,
And me?,
So?,
Hm. Yeah. Closing time. I dunno?,
"Uh-huh. Well. I hate him, but I fear you. So. I mean, I think he’ll be unbearable. But you’d be a disaster.",
Matsson took me seriously.,
He will unravel. If we don’t give him it.,
"But if we do give it to him, he’ll be unbearable. But if we don’t he’ll be unbearable and angry and might kill himself …",
Well you say that. But. Then we probably go mad and – I dunno. Not great.,
I don’t know if he kind of gave a fuck about anything except one foot in front of the other?,
Unless?,
… We kill him?,
Just a bit of horseplay gone wrong. Bonk. Biff. Coconut to the noggin.,
"If we killed him, we could go to bed?",
‘You shouldn’t have murdered me. You guys are the worst!’,
Um?,
"Er, I dunno. I – I guess. It’s weird, I’ve always been very much a one-person unit. But I’ve doubled my occupancy. And it’s— I’m very private, but now I have another person on board.",
"Not a huge issue. No, pretty far down the list of concerns. But good one.",
Hey – we were thinking of murdering you.,
But too much prep. Too much murder admin.,
Okay. So. We anoint you.,
You  smile.,
"Walk upstairs naked and say ‘I’d like a quiet word, Jonathan. In my ass!’",
"Lick the inside of the toilet bowl. Or, no, Rome: meal fit for a king!",
I’m actually starving – is there – there something for a sandwich?,
Meal fit for a king! Meal fit for a king! Meal fit for a king!,
You are going to be such a great CEO. If this doesn’t kill you. Which it definitely will.,
A little bit of Tabasco. Oooh  Tabasco!,
We are  celebrating. We’re in mourning. We’re trying to kill him.,
"I’ve had some negative news. So, we were having a friendly discussion about who it should be?",
"‘Don’t touch Peter’s Müller Corner, sweetheart, I brought it over in a hankie.’",
Okay. Here we go! Meal fit for a king!,
Drink it and shut the fuck up!,
Con wants to know if we’re making the Great Reallocation?,
He is kinda losing his shit? He’s— He wants to clear out?,
We call them SPCs.,
The TBSPC.,
Con?! Where are the medals?,
You saw the Wisconsin court thing?,
"Uh-huh. Or maybe Mencken won’t do it, ah? And maybe you’ll get to keep him all to yourself!",
Hey.,
You okay? You’re not getting canned?,
Oh. No. No. That’s all fucked.,
Yeah. Matsson either changed lanes or was stringing me along the whole time. Yeah. So. We’re gonna try to fuck him on the vote. But yeah. It’s not gonna be me.,
Yup. Greg.,
Tech pal? Big hitter. Lawrence maybe?,
What?,
It’s you?,
Bullshit.,
"Fuck you, really? Fuck you. What?",
You fucking— He went for an empty suit. Jesus. ‘Maybe you should vote it through’?,
"Uh-huh, well, good luck. Motherfucker. Good  luck. Because we have the numbers!",
It’s fucking Tom.,
"It’s fucking Tom. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s run our numbers, come on, let’s fucking go.",
GoJo deal is gonna die. Maybe Frank pulls the vote. Or maybe they push it and get humiliated?,
Whatever.,
You’re coming with us huh?,
Uh-huh?,
Sure. Sure. Shall we?,
I just need one second.,
Can I have a moment please.,
"I, um. Don’t know. I want to think.",
I might have changed my mind.,
I have changed my mind.,
I can’t stomach it.,
I can’t stomach it.,
Uh-huh. I have changed my mind.,
I can’t stomach you.,
I can’t stomach it.,
It’s not all about you.,
You are not the most important one.,
Yes you do. You do you do you do.,
I don’t think you’d be good at it.,
I don’t think you’d be good at it. I don’t think you’d be good at it.,
You can’t be CEO. You killed someone.,
No.,
"I love you, but I cannot stomach you.",
Rome?,
That’s too much.,
Hey!,
"Hey, get the .",
Hey. Congratulations.,
