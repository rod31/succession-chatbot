# Succession Chatbot

**Chat with the Roy family from _Succession_!**

This project builds an AI-powered chatbot that lets you have a live conversation with members of the Roy family ‚Äî Logan, Kendall, Shiv, or Roman ‚Äî by leveraging dialogue data from all four seasons, vector similarity (FAISS), and a fine-tuned OpenAI LLM. The web interface is built with Streamlit for a fast, interactive demo.

As broadly explored in this [Wall Street Journal article](https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/television/the-weaponized-language-of-succession-eb97357f) , an element that clearly sets Succession apart from other TV shows is its exquisite attention to linguistic detail. This [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REhlyvtiIhQ) by the Nerdwriter, also beautifully highlights how characters use language to convey their personality. 

My inspiration to build this project comes from my deep fascination with how personality comes through in language. Word choice and speech can share so much about the inner workings of a person's mind. The result is a chatbot that **feels** like the characters in this show. Or, using shiv's words, "This project doesn‚Äôt just mimic speech; it channels the very soul of what makes the Roys, well, the Roys."
