# Succession Chatbot

**Chat with the Roy family from _Succession_!**

This project builds an AI-powered chatbot that lets you have a live conversation with members of the Roy family ‚Äî Logan, Kendall, Shiv, or Roman ‚Äî by leveraging dialogue data from all four seasons, vector similarity (FAISS), and a fine-tuned OpenAI LLM. The web interface is built with Streamlit for a fast, interactive demo.
