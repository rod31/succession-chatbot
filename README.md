# Succession Chatbot

**Chat with the Roy family from _Succession_!**

This project brings _Succession‚Äôs_ razor-sharp dialogue to life with an AI-powered chatbot. Built on four seasons of Roy family scripts, it uses FAISS to surface the most on-brand lines and a fine-tuned OpenAI model to stitch them into real-time conversation. The sleek Streamlit interface means you can pick Roman, Shiv, Kendall, or Logan and jump straight into the chaos.

What makes _Succession_ so hypnotic is its **weaponized language**. As the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/television/the-weaponized-language-of-succession-eb97357f) points out, every curse, double-entendre, and clipped syllable is engineered to convey power, paranoia, and performance. Nerdwriter‚Äôs [deep-dive video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REhlyvtiIhQ) breaks down how each Roy uses vocabulary as a character voice‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs Roman‚Äôs biting sarcasm, Shiv‚Äôs steely precision, or Kendall‚Äôs tortured earnestness.

I built this chatbot out of a fascination for how **word choice** and **speech patterns** reveal inner worlds. By indexing thousands of italicized lines with FAISS and guiding GPT-4o-mini with curated quotes, the app doesn‚Äôt just mimic the Roys‚Äô tone‚Äîit **channels their personality**. In Shiv's words,  
> ‚ÄúThis project doesn‚Äôt just mimic speech; it channels the very soul of what makes the Roys, well, the Roys.‚Äù

My inspiration to build this project comes from my deep fascination with how personality comes through in language. The result is a chatbot that **feels** like the characters in this show. Or, using shiv's words, "This project doesn‚Äôt just mimic speech; it channels the very soul of what makes the Roys, well, the Roys."
