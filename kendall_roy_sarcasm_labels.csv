Joining Waystar Royco you’re joining one of the most dynamic news and entertainment companies in the world. Feel it! ™,
"Yeah? Hey hey hey, man! Good to see you. So. Where are we? Are we ready to fuck or what?",
"How do you mean, dude? I’m here?",
"What, before you didn’t have your glasses on? You were smelling it? Huh? I got the call.",
I was told it did?,
"I came all the way down here, dude?",
"You know I love what you do. That’s been made clear? I’d love to keep you and your team in place, Lawrence? I love Vaulter.",
I see you. I see this.,
Oh what? Please.,
It’s going to work out.,
What the fuck? Frank. How did this happen? How can we sweeten this?,
Of course I want to pursue. I want to announce. This is part of the whole thing. Our offer is fucking good right?,
Do I want to call my dad? No I don’t want to call my dad. Do you want to call your dad?,
"Does anyone want to call their dad? No one wants to talk to a dad. Good. Okay, so, we’ve started so let’s buy this fucking company? I’m pushing the bid to one-twenty. Okay?",
"I’m right in the middle, Dad. Yes it’s okay! We’re not quite closed. I’m going to one-twenty. So that’s good. And are we still on for the announcement?",
"Great, cos obviously I’m soft floating to like Frank and Rava? And there’s obviously gossip getting soft floated.",
"By the ether. I don’t know. Well look, happy birthday, old geezer! It’s exciting. This is going to be great for you, Dad.",
What? What do they say to one-twenty?,
What’s a stupid number?,
Because one-twenty is stupid.,
Okay. Who’s this? Is this news?,
Hello?,
Excuse me?,
‘Not ’?,
Roman.,
"Good. Just finessing. You okay, man?",
Well—,
Going one-twenty-five.,
What? High or low?,
Dad?,
Fine. Good. Why are you—? Are we okay?,
Ahead of the announcement?,
"Oh. Because on my announcement, what’s the precise timing on that?",
Okay? So this is just the trust? It doesn’t affect me stepping up?,
"Dad – I’m busy, do I need to lawyer all this?",
"Fine. Marcy’s fine by me. I mean the others, might not feel the same?",
"Yeah look, Dad, on lunch. I really want to be with you but the deal—",
I really want to be with you?,
"It’s just, delicate. I mean they can handle it but—",
". Any indication. Call me. Okay? And look, this is gonna get press-released, but – by tonight I’m going to be Chief Exec of Waystar. . I just wanted you lowlifes to be amongst the first to know, okay?",
"Okay, we’re good. Talk to me— Is there word? You’re on speakerphone.",
Ugh. Shit on my dick.,
I’ll call you back. Just a few final issues with the acquisition.,
It’s under control.,
Fuck off.,
"Well, no because, there are rules—",
"Am I getting played? No I’m not getting played. I’m the puppet master. I’m all over this, like fucking – mayo. Now look, can we please clear the room please? Thank you. I’ll be out, yeah? Thanks, guys. Great input.",
Uh-huh. I know it.,
"I’m not losing this deal. We call PPG, offer to cut them in on the financing, if they make the other bid fuck off. Okay? It’s Logan’s idea.",
"I’ll keep you posted. Look, Dad, I just checked with Frank and the holidays mean the board might be hard to get together and it’s all over the web, so I’ve scheduled a call for four? Then we can issue the release?",
Yeah. Is that okay?,
No worries. You’re not even. Twenty is margin of error.,
"Yeah? It’s just as it all goes through – next two weekends will be crazy. But then – once it’s done, it would be great if—",
I don’t want to fuck things up though. I can come up to you? And then – if you want we could grab dinner for the handover?,
No? . Are you— Does that not (work)—? Are you doing (something)—? Are you seeing someone?,
Uh-huh. No. Fine. Yeah.,
"Well, obviously I’m going to be able to cope with this.",
Dad – are we—?,
"What so, Marcia will have two votes when you—?",
"Well no, Rome, it’s not an if?",
Two? Two votes. I don’t think I was aware of that when I—,
"Dad, you what?",
"But – I’m, you’re not— ??",
You  tell me.,
‘Pending events’?,
Dad?,
Well I don’t know what you’re fucking laughing about!,
What the fuck? This is – this is going to be a shitstorm. He’s going to blow the firm’s credibility. Did he look okay by you?,
"This doesn’t stand, right? Oh fucking , you’re fucking  me … ? Are you messaging? What are you …",
What are you—? Are you telling? This stays in here. This is a lockdown—,
Advice – what? You’re gonna give a double vote to a power-hungry maniac who will do  with it because she’s got our dad’s dick in some super-max pussy grip and she’s juicing him before he croaks—!,
Sure thing.,
"No fine, thanks, apologies—",
Hey. So you’ve fucked me?,
When? When ? Cos it feels like you fucked me.,
When? Like what? This is—,
"Rehab. And, Dad, that makes (no sense)—",
Are you kidding? I’m battle-hardened. Fucking year in Shanghai.,
Not a website. And I was being professional!,
I wasn’t about to get into a fucking big-dick competition.,
What?,
"Well, no.",
What?,
That’s it is it? I should have shouted at some guy? But I didn’t? So you’ve ripped up eighteen months of corporate strategy?,
"Oh, I  my father. That’s a black mark?",
To come to my dad’s fucking birthday party? We don’t know how many more there’ll be! So come on. When will you be ready? To step down?,
Five ?!,
Ten!! Dad? Seriously?,
Yeah and you’re running it into the ground. You spend all your time on costs – where’s the vision? You’re off the beat. Where’s the growth? All our graphs go down. All of them.,
It is  a fucking ! It’s a portfolio of online brands and digital video content and it’s part of a strategy to save us if you’ll just let me —,
For fuck’s sake.,
You know I’ve been floated already? There’s fucking paps outside. I’m getting asked for quotes?,
"Yeah, course, ‘fuck them’. Great media strategy, Dad, great business strategy. When the Street hears, when the board hears?  sold a very promising digital platform for buttons. You just fucking missed it, okay? Fine. Everyone misses things. But you gotta let me get our beak in. The world is—",
Oh that’s good. That is good.,
We’re playing the game?,
Same. So what are you thinking?,
"Absolutely. My thing would be, why would we do this? Shiv’s saying she’s for no, on Marcia?",
"Oh, I thought—",
How does it depend?,
That’s not a big deal.,
"As a group, we could just— Sure. I’d cram that shit right up.",
"Look my thing is – maybe it’s a package. Here’s the deal: we say no – all of us on the trust, full block. We say: stability. Stick to the plan. I take over – and we just – you two, under me – co-presidents?",
Uh-huh. But three. The power of three?,
Of course—,
"Oh – okay. Apologies. Hold it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. I’m out of here. It’s the crunch. Frank, will you be linkman here? Dad, can I—",
"Hey. Lawrence. Sorry the other offer evaporated. But we fattened the goose nice now, right?",
The number is one-forty. Cash with a stock alternative. You’re on our board. Take the stock and you’ll own a nice piece of us. Rockstar salary.,
"It is, yeah. It’s appealing.",
No. You’re OFM. One Fungible Motherfucker. You think you’re so fucking hip but all I want is the brand. The whole firm is just so much fairy dust. It just happens I want some today.,
"Yeah I think you’re going to stick around. I’m going to stuff your mouth with so much gold. Non-disclosure agreement. Non-compete. I’m going to lock you in a golden cage, fuck you with a silver dildo and pay you so much you sing whatever song I want.",
What?,
I think you’ve made a great decision and I hope there’s no hard feelings over all the cock-jousting.,
yes!,
What?,
Are you? Is this—?,
"How long, how long does the satnav say? Which app is that? Cross-check, cross-check Waze and Google Maps and Apple Maps. I don’t care about the traffic! Make it. Let’s make it. Let’s weave, man. This is my father. Middle lane! My father’s dying, let’s get me there, let’s do it. Roman? What? Is he okay? Stop crying, buddy. Please. I can’t understand anything you’re saying, man. Seriously. You’re going to make me cry. I’m there, I’m nearly there. I’ll be there now, man, okay? Hang tight. I love you. Tell Dad I love him. Okay? Oh fuck. Oh fuck. We need – we need. I don’t know what we need.",
Hey. Where are we at? How is he?,
"I just arrived? I don’t know where to stand, okay? Show me where to stand and I’ll stand there.",
"Fuck. What’s the situation? Do we need to call anyone? Are these people the best (people)? What is this – part of the hospital, is this the best – section?",
"Can you give us a picture please, and we want to just check this is the highest care level available? Look. Do they know who we are? Do they know who he is?",
"Hey, I’m sorry, we’re getting mixed messages. We have no clue what’s going on.",
We need to know what’s happening. There are hundreds of thousands of American jobs dependent on his wellbeing.,
"So, look, what happened, exactly?",
It’s definitely a brain hemorrhage? Is that what they said?,
Did someone say hemorrhage or is it just you who said it?,
Why aren’t we chasing this?,
Are you insane?,
"We need to call Dad’s doctor. And his neurologist. We need to be on this, now!",
"Great, get in there and operate, Doctor Google.",
ATN obituary. They want us to okay it in case they have to run it?,
Made by his own news outfit? It doesn’t say he was a prick. You wanna (watch it)—?,
"There’s nothing in here about Mom, or Connor’s mom. They need to be included.",
That’s not the name I have.,
And is he okay?,
"Doctor, look, ranked, what are the most likely outcomes?",
Already? People are sending shit already?,
Call him and tell him that is not fucking appreciated.,
Do I need to hear this right now?,
"I am not thinking about the stock right now, okay?",
‘Funky chowder’?,
What have you set up?,
Jesus. Hi.,
Er – we don’t know.,
"Look, my dad is my focus right now.",
I don’t know what you’re talking about.,
As in?,
Roman? Jesus.,
"I’m sorry, I can’t get into this right now.",
"But here’s my take. My dad got sick today. Right? I don’t know, nobody knows when he started acting out of character, but he didn’t seem great from the morning on, and, there’s no paper on any of the moves made today, right, Gerri?",
"It was words and words are – what? Nothing. Complicated airflow. So, if I was saying what   today? It would be nothing.",
Yes.,
"Okay? Right. Well— So, um, listen, I don’t want to even think about this but I just spoke to the nominating committee.",
"The thing is, that the plan is to announce that I take over from Dad. That’s the plan.",
Excuse me?,
"Okay, well, let’s talk about it—",
"Hey, I’m upset too!",
Oh fuck you. I could – I could hardly hear them for the blood rushing in my ears and—,
Yes there’s a plan – that’s what I’m fucking telling you!,
"Shiv, that’s what we have to talk about, me and Frank will take over.",
"Okay, well let’s discuss – and just see where we are and—",
Yes?,
What events? What story?,
"Okay. Fuck. You okay, man?",
"Dude, he just turned eighty.",
Not great. He’ll be fine.,
"Maybe. Yeah. Look, I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. I need to get back in there – this is nuts. I’ll call you. Look, we don’t know what’s going on. He could be fine, he could not. Either way he’s not going to be back tomorrow. So long story short: will you carry on as COO and step up on the board and—?",
Yes.,
What?,
I don’t know if he even knew what he was saying? If his brain was working.,
"Look, whatever else, there’s no proof, legally, that yesterday even happened …",
What’s the problem?,
"Look – this is a horrible day. But it could also be a, a – positive day. Me and you? Yeah? Me CEO, you Chairman. We could do great things together— What do you need, Frank?",
"Frank, I don’t understand?",
There’s nothing I can say to change your mind?,
"Um, look, so I know you don’t want to talk about this, but I’m just informing you Roman as a board member, and Shiv as a shareholder, I’ll be taking temporary charge as CEO and Chairman. Frank is not interested in the position at present and therefore—",
I’m sorry then who the fuck would it be?,
Are you insane?,
"I don’t think so, dude. Dad wasn’t thinking straight.",
"You, the ‘Chief Operating Officer’? If that wasn’t a sign he was loco in the coco I don’t know what is.",
"It was a position, Rome, he was playing you, do you even know what it fucking involves? He conked out midgame.",
"No. Rome! I love you, man, but you’re not a serious person.",
Well we need to move. The markets are going to want to know who’s behind the wheel. We need to control the narrative.,
"Fuck you. Everyone knows he’s in the hospital, we have to say something.",
"We’re required to announce. There are rules, there are laws.",
Oh come on! Look at the fucking orchids! It’s like we’re being held hostage at the Honolulu Airport.,
"It’s called a lie, Shiv. When you say the thing that’s not. That’s a lie.",
Lawrence. How you doing?,
"Yeah so listen I’m just calling to issue a reminder. Your pecker’s in my pocket, okay, Dickless Dickleby? I just got bothered by some piece of guttershit about my dad and what went down yesterday. I’m just making sure you weren’t planning a move in that direction?",
Have you seen this?,
Thank you. Could you give us a minute?,
Lawrence is running a story about how the company’s in turmoil.,
"Uncertainty, discord. That is not a good story. ‘Family Gets Behind Other Member of Family’, that’s a good story.",
"We’re in a hospital, Shiv. Everyone knows. We can’t just prop him up and wave his hand and say he’s fine like they did in the Politburo or fucking .",
"Look you can’t put a value on a human life. Except in our case you rather precisely can because when trading opens tomorrow we’re going to drop like a stone. The only question is, what’s the bottom? I think I’m the best option.",
"Fuck off, Tom.",
"I was about to be announced, how can I not be the logical choice?",
He did not fire me. He said it was just going to take a little longer.,
The board are offering this to me. I don’t need your backing.,
"Jesus, Shiv, we’re going to court now?",
"Look, what have you got against me?",
Nothing?,
Yes.,
Oh my god! Bullshit.,
"No, no. I’ve heard enough.",
Good!,
Hey – pal – why don’t you go make out with Willa?,
Who else are you going to get?,
"She doesn’t work in the company and has no experience of the company and the markets would freak. But apart from that, I agree with you.",
"Sure, you could all ask for morphine. So you can carry on in your painless dreamworld where the orchids dance and the company’s run by a – hipster – fucking unicorn!",
It’s nearly four a.m.?,
How are they doing?,
"Would you mind bringing them in tomorrow? Just so they can say their … their, hellos.",
"Good. Yeah. I don’t know. Calm then – then, yeah. How am I feeling? Fuck. Ask me another.",
Yeah. The nominating committee want me to be the big boss.,
‘Yay.’ Acting. But Shiv and Roman won’t back me. Because of what Dad said at lunch.,
What can I say. Adrenalin. I don’t know. It’s just my body. I’m glad you’re here.,
"So, man, look, I’ve been thinking and this is my vision: We go for it. Me and you. CEO and COO. Me and my Homey Romey?",
"A dipshit, and you said that?",
"It’s been a long night. But seriously, me and you, bro. I can teach you — and you can, you know, teach me.",
You know what Shiv’s like. She’s a daddy’s girl. She wants to play it safe. We’re the ones with the nuts to revolutionize.,
"Alright, then. Let’s fucking do it.",
Are you fucking with me?,
This your move. Scare me off? Who asked Gerri?,
It was ‘mooted’? By who? Fucking Moot-zart? The Count of Mooty Cristo? Did you moot?,
"So, listen, I’ve asked Roman to be Acting COO—",
To my Acting CEO.,
I thought you were a fucking White Helmet?,
Why would you say no to this and yes to Gerri?,
"Yeah well, she doesn’t want it.",
Like who?,
Karl? Yeah? You trust him? And what if it isn’t temporary? What if he uses his position to make it permanent?,
Wouldn’t he? How do you know?,
Oh he bought coffee? Then we should definitely let him take control of the company?,
"It’s a gamble. It’s either me and Roman and us as a family. Or it’s Eva and Karl or some fuck-droid from the deep state of the company. They could take the company out of our hands, and we’d never get near it again. If Dad wakes up – and he’s frail and he’s looking at the endgame – do you want to be the one who tells him his family business isn’t family- run anymore? I mean, maybe you could get away with it? His favorite …",
What is this?,
What are you—? No.,
Fuck off. I’d know.,
What about Dad??,
What the— Gerri? What the fuck is going on? Was he secretly funding the war in Afghanistan – and paying LeBron James to lead the fucking infantry?,
Where it’s hidden from view?,
"Okay. Okay, we can deal.",
"But they won’t, they’ll renegotiate, right?",
Uh-huh.,
Got a cigarette?,
"I’ve just been appointed head of one the biggest media companies in the world and I’ve also been in rehab for drug addiction and it’s possible my dad might die at any second – so excuse me if I don’t get stoned out of my gourd with you right now, cuz. . But a cigarette would be great.",
"Yeah, this is dumb but – bank call this morning. And I just wanted to ask—",
"Um, no, no, Rava!  bank. ICBC who’ve apparently bankrolled the old man for years— I said?",
Yeah. Two minutes. Do I play hard-on or softcock? What’s your read?,
"You’re just, you’re always smart – and just … hard-on or softcock?",
"What’s he doing? Let me: Hello! Ive – listen to me, you need to be cool with your sister. Alright? Remember your strategies?",
"I know. I know it will. So, I’ve been thinking and I’ve got a new strategy for the call?",
Hey. Don’t look so fucking nervous. It’s making me nervous.,
Absolutely. The new strategy is really just a refinement of all this great work— It goes— Well the working title is: ‘fuck you’.,
Uh-huh. What do you think?,
My dad’s a bastard. They need to know I’m a bastard too. Right?,
"Great. Hey, Mr Polk?",
Likewise. Great. So? You wanna go?,
"Um, well, we just wanted to make contact, given where we are.",
"Absolutely. Now obviously, look, the main thing is we just handle this very calmly because the last thing either of us want is for this rather private arrangement my father made to cause waves?",
"But I guess the issue is, we owe you three-point-two billion.",
"Hey, I was rounding down!",
Secured against Waystar stock which is undergoing some temporary turbulence due to sector-wide factors. So – I guess what I’d like to know is what your position will be if we have a sustained breach of the stock price and we fall out of compliance with our debt covenant?,
"Uh-huh. Exactly. Technically. So what – what will we do here in, reality?",
Right – I know. But really?,
"I get it. That’s your starting position, but we will want to restructure, and—",
"Oh come on, man, fuck off. Hello?",
Yeah? C’mon. Real world. Can we start to negotiate?,
"Fine, well let’s keep talking—",
"Was that— I never (met Polk), is that typical of him?",
Give me a level?,
You were listening in?,
Are they for real. Would they squeeze us?,
"But why would they? They won’t, will they?",
No it fucking necessarily won’t. If this became public. We could nosedive. We could death spiral here.,
Fuck off.,
"No. No, Shiv— What?",
"I can’t do this now, Shiv.",
Still pissed at you for not signing up to his corporate restructure? To make Marcia queen of the castle?,
I heard he wasn’t up to seeing people?,
"Rome – you saw him, right?",
Four days is not a week.,
We don’t want to rush the recovery.,
"Shiv, this is— I literally have something unmissable. Later, I’ll try later, okay?",
"No, we’re on the brink of total corporate collapse.",
"Yeah well we’ve got a very aggressive drop in our share price, so I think that’s appropriate, good? So brief this wide and brief it fast, okay?",
"Morning morning morning! Hey hey hey. My people. How’s it going? Great to see you all. You know my brother and I, CEO and COO? Gerri and Karolina?",
So. Just wanted to get the group together early in my tenure to say: Yo. You’re probably all wondering about my dad. He’s doing okay.,
We’re hoping for a full recovery.,
Uh-huh. Slow and steady.,
That’s right. This morning he tried to put on a sock. And welcome to Tom Wambsgans who was managing resorts and is now sitting up with the grown-ups.,
"So – what I want to discuss with you all this morning, is a new strategic vision. We have a great firm here. Multifaceted. Parks, cruises, et cetera. But at the heart, media: TV, movies, books and newspapers. And what we’re fighting for is eyeballs. Eyeballs we sell to, eyeballs we crate up and auction to advertizers. And bottom line: we’re losing. To monopolistic disruptors: Alphabet, Facebook.",
"But we are still, just –  in a position to leverage our brands into something in the new landscape. But if we don’t, we’re gonna be like the biggest fucking horse trader in Detroit, 1909, okay? We need a more dynamic strategy – let’s call it, for the sake of clarity, the Strategy of a Thousand Lifeboats. Vaulter is a lifeboat. ATN Citizens is a lifeboat. There are no bad lifeboats.",
"VR’s a bubble. But yeah, no bad ideas.",
"Except that. That’s a bad lifeboat. Hey – thanks, Rome. Look, this isn’t a brainstorm, all I’m saying: Everyone’s invited. I want all of you to be innovating, challenging, and bringing me a hundred lifeboats. Be bold, be disruptive! Okay? Because steady as she goes hits the iceberg?",
"Just get shit moving at parks yeah, Tom? It’s stagnant. Shake that fucking tree, C3PO?",
"Fiona— can you send flowers to Rava? Nice but, y’know, not ridiculous. They should smell like flowers, not desperation. And Fi, talk to Jess – I might want to throw a couple of items up on the internal – not a big deal, coupla TED Talks. And a documentary on the. First story. Because what are we, if not storytellers?",
"Hey. And let’s get Carlo up in here. Those kitchens are a disaster. And maybe something fun. Not ping pong, but something, y’know. Throw some tags up in here. Not that. Skate park. Climb wall. None of these, right, but the essence? Talk to me.",
Ugh. Okay.,
Not iceberg! Lifeboats! Lifeboats not iceberg. Jesus? Karolina?,
"The new regime shoot, Lawrence knows?",
Let’s not muddy it.,
"Interesting? Ideas that Dad didn’t want. Sounds appealing. But no, thanks.",
"So, Stewy, listen, I could do with a read, from someone without a dog in the fight?",
"This is tight, this is absolutely just us okay? Because a leak kills me.",
Rava?,
"I don’t have time for this – I mean, who, who’s asking? What?",
"Like who? Fucking, Paul?",
"Yeah well, look, we’re separated. Whatever. Free agents.",
"So. When I took over, found out Dad took out a huge loan, a decade ago, secret, through the holding company?",
Secured against the family’s stake in the public firm.,
Yeah. Now the stock is getting ready to breach and the bank are—,
I need a read.,
Uh-huh. Well I am trying. How’s it going to play for us to refinance elsewhere?,
Uh-huh.,
"Uh-huh? Well, obviously no, fuck off, how dare you, I’m so insulted, et cetera.",
Feels pretty good.,
"Well, you know, I probably overpaid for you, so. Gonna hurt us.",
No.,
What do you mean?,
The fuck? Who let him in?,
He can’t do that. Fucking Pepsi doesn’t just drop in to see Coke. Put him where no one can see him. South Tank. I’ll be right there.,
How are we looking?,
Mr Furness! Kind of you to drop by.,
Really appreciate it. That’s kind.,
"Well, it’s kind of you to do it in person when you could have just called, so. Thank you.",
We’ll make sure people know it’s just friendly.,
"Sure. Maybe when that news is a little less likely to kill him. Okay well I appreciate this, you’re looking great.",
That is a very kind offer.,
"Oh, Sandy, you’ve been pretty smart. Smarter than the regulators, anyway.",
"Jess, would you take Mr Furness down.",
He said I was dead in the water without him and tried to finger-bang me.,
I told him I’d rather eat my own shit.,
What?,
You know sometimes you leave the party and you wonder what everyone’s saying about you?,
I know. I know what they say about me. That. That’s how much people don’t trust me.,
You didn’t actually though?,
"I don’t fucking know. I don’t know. Okay. Look, so worst position, we sell down the stock. We survive.",
"I mean to get some cash in the holding company – sell the old outdoor ads? And for the share price, parks and cruises?",
I mean sure but – what are we doing with them? Does that make a negative a positive?,
But it’s the right direction of travel. That feels right.,
"I guess it could be a package? Lay-offs, sell-offs.",
"Well, yeah, but with a philosophy?",
The sock-meister?,
"Hey, guys! Thank you so much for doing this here. I’m sorry. And – actually— can’t stay long.",
Is he okay?,
Great! Because I probably need to let him know something.,
"Oh, okay – well, it’s just when my assistant called … ?",
Is this his request? The solitary confinement?,
"Well let him know, will you, I wanted to talk to him, keep him abreast of moves?",
It’s complicated.,
"We’re – we’re retreating. Tactically, and—",
Right. She probably has his brain in a jar and she’s working all night on his signature. For the new will. You get my flowers?,
"Listen, how about you let the nanny take the kids.",
Come back to the old place and we probably need to—,
Y’know— negotiate.,
So. Stewy. You know how everyone hates you?,
"Oh sure, they do. Private equity, getting your meat hooks in, chiseling your profit? Like a vampire locust fuck.",
"I’ve had an idea. How about instead of taking us over, you give me four billion dollars? I stay boss. You stop raiding shitty companies for scraps. You  in a blue-chip corporation. One that is currently undervalued because of some unfounded concerns about its leadership, i.e. Little Lord Shareplunge here? The story twists. Happy ending.",
Not for me.,
Really? Man?,
Are you done?,
You’re a parasite. How about for once you make things bigger. With an old pal? Are you done?,
As long as the family maintain control.,
"I’d force it on you, dude. For the optics. Shit-hot new CEO has some hot-shit new money for investment? New generation. I keep the debt out of the news. Sisters are doing it for themselves?",
That’s right and luckily I speak Stewy. And that’s Stewy for ‘I have a raging hard-on for this.’,
"Retreat? Rome, this is a million times better, right? —",
"Thanks for making time for us, Mr Polk.",
It’s a very brutal structure?,
"I mean the margin you’re making, you might even say you were— Well I mean blackmail is an ugly word. But so is getting goat-fucked.",
"Uh-huh. Sure. And professionally, we’re going to repay.",
We’re good. Everything’s golden. We don’t need you. This can all stay private and I’ll be looking elsewhere for a banking partner as we go supersonic. Goodbye.,
"I think, champagne for my friend?",
"No, it’s cool. I’ll taste it on your tongue later.",
Not suave?,
"Oh, I thought that was— No wonder all the women I date keep throwing up in their soup.",
"Well I’m not saying I’m the man but if there was a man, hypothetically, he might look a lot like me. I’ve solved the debt issue, with private equity money.",
"Yeah, well, the thing is, all of that, it’s made me think about – everything? And you know, here’s where I’m at: I love you.",
And – so—?,
C’mon?,
Yeah you do.,
"Look. You want us to live separately, we don’t know why right now, but you say you do. Now that makes me unhappy. On the other hand, you claim – though of course I don’t believe you – that us being together will make you unhappy. So. One of us is going to be unhappy. I just don’t see why it has to be me?",
We are not breaking up.,
Nope.,
"What about Malaya, can’t she—?",
Rava. Why don’t we just do it all. Back together?,
"That was nice, right?",
What? You know I’m clean.,
"And everything else, that was just the rest of that?",
"Hey, no. That’s bullshit. I’m not moving on. Rava? It all comes down to work and family. That’s all I want. That’s the secret sauce.",
Marcia. Everything alright?,
Hey. Look at you. Sitting up. Fucking watching the news!,
"It’s good to see you. Probably your first bit of downtime since the womb, right? You understand, after you went down, the stock tanked. You should be flattered, I guess. We had some pretty shitty options. But I found us a private equity solution so. I tried consulting but— Karolina says there’s positive analyst noise. People like the shape of this. We’re at thirty-six percent. Effective control. Plus a war chest to make some moves. We’re – we’re in good shape, Dad. Keep getting better. I got this.",
"Dad, can I get you something?",
"Hey, Rava? Did you make a decision yet? Well, no it’s not CEO arm-meat. Rava, this is a big night for me. I’m making Dad’s Wasp Trap speech. Fine. I just kind of assumed your ‘hopefully’ was a yes. Yes you said ‘hopefully’. I remember— I’m not trying to be anything. I know you, ‘hopefully’ implied a yes, you know what a big deal this is for the family but if you’ve changed your mind that’s cool just don’t try to tell me …",
Ugh.,
"Great. They’re all fucking nuts, but great. Can you get on to Lance about my speech? Can we get one of the late-night guys to cook me up a bit?",
A selection of jokes and riffs.,
What does that mean? I was fucking king of the . Kicked their distribution into shape too.,
Who’s that in my dad’s suite?,
"No, I didn’t know. But— Great news. I’m delighted. Right? Did you know?",
"Hey, Dad! What’s all this?",
I didn’t know you were coming in? Did Gerri?,
"Hey, screw you! You okay? Are you well enough to be in? Did you use the chair?",
"The wheelchair, Dad.",
"Oh, you wanna get into that? You put a hole in us by taking on a shitload of debt, Pop? But – look, this is great to see you. So what’s the plan? Do you want to schedule a catch-up every so – often, so you can, you know, keep up to date?",
"Good. Because, you know, things are cooking. Fucking, brave new world.",
I was told you suggested it?,
"What, you don’t want me to—",
You’ll be missed. We’ll raise a glass. You sure you’re okay? Why don’t you get a briefing and head home? Yeah?,
"Back to check in. I hope he’s okay. It’s fast, right? But good.",
"Roman, Jesus, man, no. I’m just scared in case he—",
Hello? Did we have something scheduled?,
Seriously? Frank?,
"It’s, I don’t— It’s a question.",
"Look. Relax. The dinosaur’s having one last roar at the meteor before it wipes him out. It’s, expected.",
"I’ll talk to Frank. But, look, you’re doing a great job.",
"I know it, bro. Tell me about it.",
"Um, I guess, I mean it is a CEO thing, so, I think maybe, I mean I have a whole thing prepared, with jokes and so—",
No one. Rava’s busy.,
"So, I’ll probably— Maybe I’ll fly solo?",
Sure. I’ll take something. A head on a stick. A cauliflower with lipstick. I mean know who I’d like to take? Anna Newman. From ATN?,
Not cool. I’m her boss.,
You’re a walking fucking lawsuit.,
"Hey? So, why, Frank?",
He never wrote the press release before?,
"Money? Any fuckhead can turn a few million a year, Frank.",
Uh-huh?,
You know what my dad used to say? He’d say he loved all his employees. But he particularly loved the guys who ate the shit for him and he never even knew it?,
"Yup, he made it in. Which we were all delighted about—",
No he’s great. Likes to remind us he’s still alive! Great to get his take. But he needs . Dad? Hey. Just talking about you.,
Okay? Good thought. I’ll come find you and we can discuss.,
Okay. It’s not necessarily the best option in the sector (so we can discuss)—,
"Dad, it’s a really flooded sector. Lot of hustlers. Lots of bullshit. It’s a gold rush.",
"Great outdated sexism, Dad, but I’m sure you’re all over the data mining.",
"You okay. Dad, should I get someone? You shouldn’t be here, you know.",
"Great, well thanks for sharing, old guy! Still recovering.",
"Well as I explained, Dad, I think they’re kind of snake oil salesmen. They’re the people who – you buy a refrigerator and their algorithm is sending you thirty ads for more fridges? Great algo!",
I’ll get Jess to—,
Jess? Has anyone—?,
He means the RECNY Ball.,
"Nah, I’m afraid—",
You think a lot of people come in here and take a piss?,
Yeah maybe the massive fucking ice sculpture I forgot about melted? It’s urine.,
"Why the fuck are you looking like that. What if people knew? Gerri, you have to talk to him.",
"He came . He was  to Stewy. I mean, what’s he going to do next? Start jizzing in my coffee? Take a dump on my iPad?",
"If he thinks he’s okay to come back, he should talk to you, Gerri, and the nominating committee and set a date, right?",
He says he’s coming tonight.,
What if he freaks out? What if he falls asleep in his soup? What if he starts shouting – racist comments.,
We have a fiduciary duty not to let the company look – nuts?,
What did I do?,
"Yeah my dad’s first wife thought she was gonna, you know, empty the ghettos and get everyone into ballet when they started this thing. So patronizing.",
A couple of kids who got into New York City Ballet still send us cards at Christmas though so I guess that’s nice or whatever?,
What?,
"Hey, come on, what?",
Everything okay?,
Is there anything I can do to put you at ease?,
And you’d tell me if you weren’t?,
What?,
Excuse me?,
"Con. He’s in no fit state. Is he okay? I mean this could be, does he know where he is?",
"There’s like, pension funds, there’s analysts, there’s major investors. This is fucking high-risk. Gerri?!",
Dad wants to talk? Gerri?!,
It’s great.,
And what was that?,
"What the fuck is wrong with you, Dad?",
I have no fucking idea what you—,
What do you— I was going to do one fucking joke about how you’d never retire?,
"Why didn’t you just talk to me? I’ve no idea where this has come from, Dad?",
"Hey. So look, Anna. Can I just ask? Is there – something – going on here?",
"Like, I don’t know, is there – an atmosphere, did I say something to offend you?",
"Uh-huh. Thank you. So am I crazy? I feel like I’m on a date with an app, like there’s invisible bubble wrap?",
"Well asked. I asked her to just, ask your people.",
What? No I’m not that guy? Okay?,
"What did she say, Eva?",
Was she joking?,
Well – I think I should (say something)—,
Sure.,
That’s not the law.,
"Hey, what you got cooking?",
Local TV stations?,
"Maybe raw numbers, but the demographic? I mean for Waystar, is it a good ‘look’?",
"Look, I can see short term we make cash but (in terms of a strategy where)—",
"Yeah, I’ll get the T-shirt made.",
That’s great but it’s unrealistic.,
"Oh, Dad! C’mon?",
"You sure do love telling people what to think, don’t you?",
"The politics on this would be horrible. Justice, FCC. Antitrust. We’d be tied up for years—",
"Look. Fine. I don’t want to make this a thing – you like local TV, great, you’re smart. I just hope it doesn’t mean we can’t pursue diversification and innovation. The Biggest Turkey in the World",
What?,
"Excuse me, are you serious?",
Yeah it’s great. YOUNG EXECUTIVE 1 Just to say though. Down in the ‘Pig Sty’ we’re all huge fans of your stuff. The innovation.,
Is it true? About the coffee?,
Jesus. He’s not right.,
I am NOT going back to Shanghai. I  the company when he was sick.,
fucking patronizing.,
When I— When one of us eventually takes over what’s going to be left?,
"The firm’s being run by a compulsive hoarder. It’s this big old ugly spooky house and he’s all caked up in the middle covered in fucking moldy newspapers, with the local news blaring, feeding Wonder Bread to raccoons.",
I should.,
Yeah. I can’t do that.,
"Look, you didn’t come back out of love for my father. So I guess what I wanted to ask was, what’s your plan?",
"Sure, wasn’t he one of the Seven Dwarves? No? A rapper. Was he a part of the Wu-Tang Clan? I’m sorry, I gave everyone Thanksgiving off. So, look, Dad’s not well, right? The business decisions are not cogent, they’re old-man shit. But that’s his call in some ways you know, but he pissed on my fucking floor? What if that got out? No one wants to say it, but we can because we basically love him, but he’s not okay. What about he wakes up one night fucking calls – Bezos and sells us out for a dollar? I just want what’s for the best.",
He’s sick. Do you think the real Logan would want us to stand by and watch while he throws it all away?,
"So, there’s Roman, me, you, who’d stand up against him—",
The pods? Three grams of coffee in six grams of packaging? The inventor of those is basically Oppenheimer.,
"And even if he did, he hates Dad. How about Gerri?",
"No CEO has ever survived a successful vote of no confidence, right?",
"That’s the spirit, killer. So, are we doing this?",
"It doesn’t need to be horrible, right?",
For Dad.,
Ewan’s here? Uncle Ewan?,
He brought her to Thanksgiving?,
"It’s not cool, man, one day that’s a story?",
"Forget it. You can’t get him anything. Last Christmas. I thought I’d had an idea, new MacArthur biog. He got seven copies.",
Plan is a big reconciliation.,
"Marcia, I think. You figure she’s on maneuvers?",
"Hey. Good to see you, Uncle Ewan. It’s been too long.",
"Dad? Resting, I guess.",
"Yeah, I guess he’s still pretty sick. So. I mean, he’s up and about. But he’s … not really … quite his old self? He’s actually acting kind of … strange.",
"They’re on their way but … please, go ahead. It’s hard for her, you know, her stepdad is very demanding so—",
How about Dad? Will he be joining us at all?,
"I’m worried about him, Marcia.",
Well I am happy. Mission accomplished. Don’t worry about me.,
"It’s clear what I want to do. And what do you want to do, Marcia?",
Uh-huh? Yeah?,
Hey? Where’s Iverson?,
It’s fine. I will. I thought we were in first position?,
"I know. I guess, he had it pretty rough. Different generation.",
"I wasn’t saying that, Rava, fuck, I was just saying maybe Iver would like to feel where the line is sometimes?",
Hey!,
Can we talk?,
Yep.,
"He’s tough. He is tough. There’s something in there, but he’s tough.",
I think he has changed. I don’t think he’s himself at the moment. He’s a lot sicker than he’s letting on.,
"He’s erratic, he’s making bad decisions. I’m serious. If he’s not careful he’s going to destroy the company.",
"I’m considering. Look. I never got a chance to know you, Ewan. But I liked you. I’m going to say something now. And I’m, I’m putting my prick in a cigar-cutter here. But at the next board meeting, there’s going to be a vote of no confidence. I mean, do you have confidence, in him? So. What do you say?",
"I’m only thinking— It’s for his own good, for everyone’s good.",
Of course not. I want him to be able to relax.,
I’ll call one of our guys.,
Yeah me too. The food. Amazing.,
What the fuck are you doing?,
"He can’t relax, can he?",
Are you hurt? Did he hurt you?,
I don’t know. Everyone’s pretty upset. Don’t take any notice.,
Oh I don’t know. It’s just the usual family hatred you get at Thanksgiving. You know how it is.,
Yeah. I’m planning on going home and taking some Advil.,
"Yeah well, no one can argue with his record. You know he used to give us a mirror, when we were kids, to show us how ‘dumb’ we looked crying?",
Okay here we go. Here we go.,
You’re imperial. This is imperial right now. Imperial.,
"Be cool. Be cool, Stew.",
Jess – will you?,
"So, listen, can I talk to you about something?",
"He’s ‘decompressing’? What, from his journey to the bottom of the fucking pop-rap ocean?",
"I need to ask you something, but once I’ve asked, I’ll have asked, and while it’s not a big deal, it’s delicate?",
You give toothy head. Everyone at school said so.,
I haven’t fucked the company. I have something to tell you.,
"Look, we’re friends. I can trust you, right?",
"Sure, but on money stuff I can trust you?",
"Good, look, I know, deep down, I can trust you. Which is why I’m going to tell you this …",
I have a collection of Victorian dolls and I hump them and cry into their hair.,
What? You look so serious. No you’re going to want in on this and on the right side because – we’re calling a vote of no confidence in my dad.,
It’s the best way forward right now.,
"Relax. It’s just cleanest. He’s, he’s – lost it. He’s going to Washington tomorrow. To piss away our political capital and cement us in a dying sector.",
"Of course. It’s finished. Not even close. I’m informing you, not courting you.",
"Right – with me. So – we good, can I count on your vote for Team Future?",
"Stewy, you staying? Tell him I had to go, and he’ll be shooting his next promo on a fucking flip phone.",
"It went great. He’s in, naturally.",
So we’re all good.,
Rock solid. Already floated and noted.,
"Yeah well, sure. I mean— But sure.",
"Could do, if we wanted, just, is he unpredictable?",
Looks good?,
Could? Could. Don’t want to spread the news too wide?,
Logan would sell Vaulter for parts. Lawrence would be crazy not to vote with me.,
Bluster. He’s my bitch. * * * *,
Sure. We hit Lawrence. Okay?,
"It’s okay, I got him.",
"Rome, it’s delicate …",
And he likes you?,
"Hey. One detail, Frank – do we need to slip something in the agenda to cover the vote?",
Rock solid. Okay? And final nail. Roman’s having dinner with Lawrence.,
And what – she punched you?,
"We’d just finished, buddy.",
"Bag him, yeah? I need him. We need him, brother.",
"Hey, Tom, just to say, I know you’ve been eating a lot of shit for me that I don’t even know about, and I appreciate that.",
"And I want you to know. I like you. You’re Team Kendall, man. Lot of stuff going down, but you’re on the team, okay? Do me a favor. Keep your ear to the ground, let me know anything you hear won’t you?",
… Yes?,
Did he ask to have dinner with me?,
Just him and me?,
"Uh. No, of course. Um, I’m around.",
"So, listen, Marcia’s asked me to have dinner with Dad?",
I don’t know.,
"Well it’s either tonight, or tomorrow, but he’s gonna find out, bro, so I’m going.",
What did Lawrence say?,
For real?,
Great. Thanks. If you don’t hear from me assume we’re good.,
"Tom, can this wait till tomorrow?",
Who’s your source?,
"Fuck! Seriously? Fuck! Okay, Tom, you do not breathe a word of this.",
"Alright. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. Big time. I won’t forget this.",
"Hey, Dad? Should you be eating that?",
Did you want to talk? Marcia said you wanted to see me?,
What does that mean?,
What’s your game?,
What’s going on?,
"What? Oh, yeah. I heard. It’s tough to read. I heard real security alert? But who knows. You know what I think of the whole endeavour. I still think if you changed your mind that could be great for everybody …",
I don’t think so. No. I don’t think so.,
"Er, we have Lawrence.",
I’m just going to call Sarita and check Ilona’s out of the action.,
"Just to cover all the bases. Frank. Listen, is this? Is this – objectively, horrible? Is it time to—? Should we hold off, should we see what develops and then we can put this together next quarter or—?",
Hi Sarita. Sorry to call so late. I was just – thinking and—,
"Still all good. Tight, but, you know, all the variables swing our way?",
Sarita?,
"No, no. That’s not it at all. That’s— Can I explain?",
"Okay, well there’s some context and – there’s some issues. I know— Look, could I come and talk it through?",
"I’ll be there in an hour. We need to talk. Thanks, Ilona!",
Are you ready? Let’s go.,
"No. I need to go, pal. I’ll pay whatever fine they hit us with. Let’s go.",
"What do you need to take off right now? Anything. Whatever you lose financially, I’ll make up in perpetuity.",
What is going on? What?,
Tell Jess to put me through the … Polycom. Yes?,
Hey everyone. I apologize. I will be there shortly. Where are we at?,
I can do this. Dad. This is big. Look. I love my father. My father is a legend.,
Nothing will ever detract from what he’s built and what he’s done. But he is currently unfit to run this company. Not just because of his refusal to take the time to recover from serious health issues. But because every day he refuses—,
Is he there – is he still in the room?,
Me. My hand is raised. More in sorrow than in anger.,
Lawrence?,
"Gerri, you want to say anything to speak, to the senior management team’s attitudes here?",
Right. Thanks.,
Dad this is an in-house— You don’t have to—,
I need to get some things.,
"Hey, Rava?",
Uh-huh? What?,
Did we say yes to Instagram?,
"What, I haven’t been looking at anything, deliberately, Rava—",
"What is it, what?",
Rava. That’s not true.,
"Jesus. I’m not using, Rava, I don’t touch anything, you know that, Jesus Christ!",
Okay. ‘Unrelated’.,
No! Fuck.,
"I’m not fucking angry! I bet it’s Dad! He’s a bully and he can’t take someone standing up to him – I’m not on drugs, I’m not on drugs, I’m not taking fucking drugs.",
Rava … ?,
Maybe. Patricide. Fratricide.,
Hey have you got any non-alcoholic beer?,
"Fine, sparkling water please. Mineral water.",
No. What? I probably think the same.,
Jesus.,
Okay. Lot of wolf stuff.,
Okay.,
Yes. Okay.,
You get wolves here?,
I never did meth. This is like an experiment. My family own that.,
"There’s a thing now that Type A’s actually – can’t get addicted, because we are addicted.",
I’m not a real person.,
How much more you got. We need to get more. And some weed. And some Xanax some Oxy and some cigarettes.,
Experiment successful. I am interested in becoming a methhead. That’s cats anyway—,
Who only make sounds for us. They don’t meow at each other.,
Sure. I got money.,
New Mexico.,
I realize now.,
No. I’m at some guy’s house and we’ve been taking drugs but I’m very clear.,
I’ve got a lot of important information in play.,
It’s okay. It’s my brother.,
"Hey look, I probably shouldn’t even be talking to you, legally, given the ongoing situation apropos of my legal action against you as a board member for your failure to fulfill your fiduciary duty and breach of my employment contract. But – I’ve had a major realization.",
"We’ve had all kinds of fun, thanks, Mom.",
Tanner makes good points.,
How’s the therapy?,
"Gentlemen, this has been divine.",
think so.,
"Hey, hey hey! What we fighting about, muthafuckers??",
"Oh, where do we start?",
"I’m off my nut, folks. Off my fucking head. Like all the papers said. Your dreams have come true, congratulations! —",
"Shut up, Rome! The king is angry. The king is displeased and everyone needs to pretend he’s wearing clothes.",
"He doesn’t even fucking notice, Rome. Give him a high-five, Dad. Come on. He’s waiting.",
"You don’t have a business strategy, Dad! Your whole business model is based on seducing presidents. You’re a really high-class hooker. No offense.",
"I liked those stories you planted about me, Dad. That was fucking nice.",
"C’mon, everybody, it’s a rootin’ tootin’ super-fun fuckin’ game for all the family!",
"You know, I’m lucky. I’m a lucky person. I lucked out. I realized that. You’re so fucking jealous aren’t you? You’re so fucking jealous of what you’ve given your own kids. And you can’t … You can’t work it out.",
What? What would evil Uncle Noah do?,
Cos that’s some big advance calling your daughter a coward till she cries.,
Bro? How about some more bass in the back? I like to feel my teeth dance.,
Please excuse Captain fucking Bee-Bop here. How’s it going? Nice shirt. Big fan of what you do. Fucking sweet potatoes.,
"I don’t need to hear the pitch. Because I’ve X-rayed your business and I get how it works. You buy bullshit from idiots and you sell it to pricks. Art-school student makes a painting, you jack up the price, skim it, sell it on.",
"No absolutely, I get it. You’re giving a platform to marginalized talent. I’m just telling you how this works from the outside, to the sharks.",
Yeah well. Apologies. I’ve been a little busy revolutionizing tech financing.,
What is this? Some pop-up shit?,
"I’ll be fine, man. Thank you.",
"Uh-huh. I’m incubating. I’ve been out on the west coast sprinkling fuck-dust. Rebalancing away from crypto, into eco.",
Better than being carried around in Dad’s pockets like fucking Stuart Little—,
How is he? Still using your fragile self-esteem as a punchbag?,
Wow. A spaceship?,
"Good for you, bro.",
Stewy?,
You’re my third oldest friend and you fucked me like a tied goat. We’re great.,
"Not me, business is my fucking.",
Angela? Dust? Yeah? Hey?,
We just got here. Cool. Very cool.,
"This must be synchronicity, huh? Two people meet in a warehouse and the fucking world changes?",
I’m super-excited.,
"Well, you have a great night, Angela.",
"Can I help you with something, Greg?",
Not going to lie. Great. Seeing the kids. Growing kale. Following my nose. Intrigued by vegan meat.,
I get it. Friends are friends but money’s money.,
Hello?,
Consisting of what?,
Bullshit.,
Why would you want to be even more in? The place is a fucking antique shop.,
Well. It’s not uninteresting. Because I’ve got a lot cooking. An artificial sun. Clean beef made in the lab.,
Sandy comes to these things?,
Thank you. You look – incredibly out of place. So. You wanted to talk?,
Why do I feel like I’m about to find out you’re not my real mommy and daddy after all?,
As in?,
Seriously? Stewy? Jesus Christ.,
You obviously should have disclosed this to me when I brought you in. You acted like kind of a snake?,
He very much would not.,
I have a fund. We’re small but we’re engaged. Only work with good people. I’m interested in adopting an ethical posture.,
"Just closed a deal tonight. Also there’s these four Stanford grads, they have a piece of proprietary tech, it’s a cluster of hydrogen lamps in a honeycomb formation and it makes a kind of artificial sun—",
"Where’d you spring from, Heidi?",
We were just talking.,
Rome? The adults are talking. How about you go play in the other room?,
Roman. Could you maybe back off for like twenty minutes?,
Maybe just dial it in like . Get us a drink.,
‘Logan’.,
He’s doing satellites like it’s 1985. Dad’s got him holding the plastic wheel in the back and telling him he’s driving.,
How about you fuck off back to your little gangbang?,
You’re embarrassing yourself.,
What the fuck?,
You’re tripping.,
You need to stop talking.,
What the fuck are you doing?,
What was that bullshit?,
Yeah but you— That was – that was insane.,
What happened?,
Okay. I never made you eat dog food.,
"It was a game. You enjoyed it. Ask Connor, ask Shiv.",
So now there’s a leash. You’re full of shit.,
I know. I saw them. It’s locked down.,
Frank. I just spoke to the girl.,
What are you talking about?,
Then we match it.,
Can we talk for a second?,
I just got off the phone to Frank. He told me.,
"Listen. And I shouldn’t be telling you this, but I’m about to land a chunk of seed capital the size of fucking – Idaho so whatever it is you need I can make it happen, okay?",
Okay? We good?,
Then? Help me out here. Because there’s something I’m not seeing—,
Which – Dust?,
Okay. I get it. But that’s not me. I’m not a Roy. Not really.,
"I’m solid, I’m a good guy.",
Angela. Okay. I’m going to be frank with you—,
"Hey, wait—",
Wait – he’s been  on me?,
Okay. Well. I’m about to do these four lines of coke and then my heart’s going to explode so if you want to stop me—,
Or maybe you want to explain to my dad how you let his son OD?,
"What are you gonna do, cuz? He’s counting on you, Greg. He’s counting on you to look after me.",
And now I guess I have to go find some more.,
Connor. Not right now.,
Forget Roman.,
"Uuh. He’s still talking about that? Pathetic. He enjoyed it, right?",
"Well, rough house.",
"Hey, listen, Sandy. I appreciate your offer, I’m not getting out.",
"Keep your money, bring me in. We do this properly.",
Takeover. Leveraged buy-out.,
"Price in the toilet, shareholders are pissed. You and me could force him to the table.",
Fuck the rest of the family.,
"No one has a clue but me. I can see it all. We take it apart. Fuck local TV, newspapers, parks. We bulldoze the whole fucking shanty town. I just keep the juiciest morsels. Turn the thing from a pod of rotting whales into one bastard great white.",
CEO.,
I’m the only one who knows the architecture. The – emotional and corporate architecture.,
Fuck Stewy. He’ll follow the money like a dog in a cartoon.,
Yeah. I’m good.,
What’s happening?,
Gentlemen. Shall we? Episode Nine PRE-NUPTIAL Written by Jesse Armstrong,
How we doing?,
I got the call. You get the call?,
"So what ten days and we go in for the kill? We can’t keep it on lockdown for more than about ten days, right?",
So like the seventeenth for the bear hug? Ten days till the end of the world. Good?,
Like what?,
"If you tried to fuck me, I’d kill you.",
"Frank knows the Canadians, you want me to …?",
"I just got here, Shiv. Is this going to take long?",
"Hi, Mom.",
Bro.,
Can someone brief me?,
"Yeah, listen. You know the Canadians. Yves et cetera?",
"Yeah. What do they think of me, Frank?",
I can’t give you context.,
"Look. As a pal. If there was a situation where a private equity was trying to buy out a – ‘major media company’ – and install a new CEO, how would they view me?",
"You know those guys. Behind closed doors are they of the opinion I’m – the real deal, or – in training?",
Frank. Too soon. Get your hard-on out of my soup. I need an answer?,
"Oh shit, really?",
I need details.,
"Well I think it means they think of me as a cock ring made from calamari, Frank. It’s pretty self-explanatory. Jesus Christ.",
Who’s coming?,
Dad’s coming now? Here? Do you want him to?,
Yeah I’m sure he’s thinking about that twenty-four-seven. What you going to do? You can just say no?,
"Hey! How you going, man?! Too long. Still trying to teach the world to sing in perfect fucking harmony.",
"Pleased to meet you, Mr Eavis.",
Oh fine. I’m fine thank you. And how d’you like it here in the lion’s den?,
You like drinking our champagne?,
"Hey. You know Gil Eavis, sword of the dispossessed and lover of vintage champagne?",
Hey! Hey. When you get in? Where are the kids?,
"Oh you know, maintaining the veneer.",
"I’m great, actually.",
"I’m fantastic. I did like a hundred and twenty push-ups this morning, so, yeah, I think I’m, okay?",
"Rava, I just have a lot going on right now.",
"Yeah I’m a big fucking stress knot, what can I tell you? Probably got a tumor eating me inside out. You want another drink?",
I don’t know about that.,
Sure.,
"I’m good. Yeah the truth is my lawyers are stonewalling because your lawyers are trying to fuck me over. So shall we leave it to them and then you and me can just smile, and, you know, you can do your coy little smile and we can flirt and everything because I love all that shit?",
"Oh fuck you, everything isn’t what you think? You know? You can’t see inside me just because I’ve told you the occasional fucking thing. Hey hey hey, so what the fuck’s going on here? This looks mighty fucking cozy?",
"Hey, Mom.",
I’m good.,
Yeah. I think. You know. Whatever it means.,
Roman. I never could rely on him.,
"So, how are you, Mom?",
"Not really no. No. It’s quite hard, to know.",
"I don’t know if this is any use to you, but so you know. I used to see someone, to talk to, and I’ve forgiven you.",
What for? For – well for – leaving us and – for – for—,
"Hey, Dad.",
"Oh, keeping busy.",
I’m good.,
Yeah well. You know.,
"Uh-huh. You recruiting? What, a new Head of Being Continually Thwarted?",
You feeling the heat on your own? Want me back? Like to put that in a press release?,
"Uh-huh. Well, thanks, Dad.",
Oh he was just telling me how shitty you are at doing your job.,
Oh nothing. Think he’s shoring up his position. It’s not real. He’s under pressure.,
"Yes I’m okay! I’m not going to get cold-cocked here am I, Stewy? I heard from Frank the Canadians might not be too keen on me?",
Frank? That would be rude. He – he taught me to fly in his Cessna.,
"He’s good, Stewy.",
"Um, Stew – what is this? I was talking?",
"No. Stew. Seriously. My wife, my kids – I need to—",
You’ve what?,
What is it?,
"You can say, Stew.",
What the fuck? You’re not going to say? Is this the cold-cock?,
"You’re such a pussy. Is this – is this Canadian shit? Because I’m the only person who can do this, Stew, you know that.",
"What? C’mon, man!",
"Oh no, fuck off. What?",
At my sister’s wedding. Are you insane? What do you want this to be – ?,
Hi. Yeah he told me already. No. Absolutely not. No way. No fuck this.,
I hinted—,
"We’re all together, this isn’t a good time.",
"No. I need to prepare. Sandy? That’s just human. You know, I need to, I need prep time, for the approach?",
But we’ll be stuck here with him?,
Uh-huh. Seriously?,
Hey!,
Con? Was he invited?,
"Well, I mean, What is this?",
Likewise. Kinda lot cooking?,
One hit.,
It’s nice. Tom’s okay.,
Listen. Can I suggest a hug?,
Fine fuck you.,
"Come on, you know you want to, bitch.",
"You know we’ve been dicked over, right? By them. But it’s alright. It’s all alright.",
"There’s the games and there’s this – and the games don’t affect this, right?",
What?,
"Yeah, well.",
Does she remind you a little of Mom?,
‘Family’s a drug with no high.’,
"Deliver. He calls emergency board. We release the letter. The world blows up. The arbs dive in. He tells the world some fairy tales. Talks poison pills, other defenses. Board says, ‘Hold on, we don’t want to get sued.’ Dad says, ‘Fuck the shareholders.’ Calls analysts, calls us, tells us to fuck off. The price rockets – because everyone knows we’re going to win.",
Yeah yeah.,
Hey!,
So? That it?,
"Okay, yeah print, three of these.",
Are you serious?,
I know but I assumed – you?,
"Fine. I just guess, if like we were planning to fuck your dad to death, to make our fortune, I might offer – to actually do the fucking?",
Fuck you. No. Are you?,
Seriously?,
Fine. Fuck it – I can cope. Okay. Are we ready or what?,
But it’s not?,
What?,
"Where is it, Jess?",
"Oh Jesus! You need to find it, Jess. Now! Hey what the fuck!! No! Hello?! Hello? Oh. Hey. Hey how are you going, kiddo? Sorry. Sorry, son.",
"Hey, I’m sorry, kiddo.",
"Sure. Yes. I’m sorry, Iver.",
I’m great. I’m good. Just – some big moves.,
Okay. Okay. Listen – I’ll see you later. Okay?,
Yeah I’m doing this. You’ll email Gerri and the board?,
You don’t think I can deliver it?,
I’m good.,
Hey. Is my father available?,
It’s— I just need to have a word.,
"Do you want to, come out, Dad?",
"Hey. This isn’t a nice thing, I’m afraid.",
Um. Yeah. Read this.,
"It’s – it’s – a proposal, to buy Waystar for a hundred and forty dollars a share. We’re asking you to come to the table – open the books.",
It’s great value for shareholders.,
"Yeah. There it is, I’m not going to get into feelings.",
That’s right.,
"Well, fine. We have the financing. Let’s see what everyone thinks. Let’s keep it professional. You know, it’s just the situation that has arisen and you’re very tough and so am I, as your son, so, I think this is just the way it has to be with us. We know several major investors are in favor. We go public with the letter tomorrow. So then we’ll have to see – to see – what the arbs make of it?",
"It’s me and Stewy. And Sandy. He’s some of the cash so. I’m not sorry for what I’m doing which is – correct, but I am sorry for how it makes you feel. I’m sorry it had to be now. It was out of my hands. External factors. Here.",
I— Ideas. I have – wanted to do things.,
To save the business and and and do – do things that are—,
"I can say it. Do, some, good, things.",
Hey. —,
I did it.,
He threw it in the toilet.,
That’s a detail for our next letter to shareholders right?,
"It was horrible. It was pretty fucking horrible, Stew.",
Uh-huh? What is it?,
Oh. Okay. Okay.,
"It, it was out of my hands, Shiv – I—",
Look – we can talk. There’s no need to talk to me like I’m—,
The fact is I was forced into this position against my wishes.,
You can talk to me. I’ll answer any questions you have.,
I’m trying to save the company.,
"If this works, which undoubtedly it will, you’ll all be very very very rich and maybe it’s for the best for this to no longer be a family operation.",
Oh come on!,
The Thousand-Year Reich? Uh-huh? That will endure for eternity? Dad is fucked? You’re all – fucking – guarding a trash can full of diapers. Wake up. This is – just a little maneuver. You don’t need to get sentimental.,
"Oh, let’s not pretend, Shiv? This isn’t about Dad. This is because you like the power. It gets you close to the poles you like to grease. And Rome, you couldn’t get a job in a fucking burger joint let alone a Fortune 500 without some nepotism and – Con, you like the glamour it gives to a fucking – freak in the desert.",
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Exactly. You’re all living in a fucking dreamworld.,
"I ought to go. This is— I shouldn’t even, talk to you.",
I’m not getting into it.,
I don’t owe you anything.,
I don’t—,
"Right. Listen, we got – we got some more?",
Sure. You got a little though? In case we want – for tomorrow?,
You wanna look?,
We’re good.,
Wise. Wise. I could just do with a straightener?,
Hey.,
Yeah well.,
Good luck?,
"It has, right?",
Uh-huh.,
"So listen, do you know where I can— I wouldn’t mind a— Do you have some, something something?",
I see you.,
Hey?,
What you got on the go there?,
It’s cool. I can just smell it from down there. You know. It’s fine. Smells like – the kind bud.,
Did you— Did I see you get some shit earlier? You okay?,
For the full shift?,
"Nice. Dude, would it be weird to ask—",
Hold on— What is this?,
"Oh no. No, dude. K? I can’t— No I need a different high tonight. I was after some coke?",
No?,
Right but you can get coke?,
"Then let’s blow, is that cool?",
No? I can drive? I’ll drive. You okay?,
"You okay, bud, you gonna be able to find the way?",
Let’s get some air in.,
"Yeah, just fucking – stick shift.",
Uh-huh. Plus I don’t drive that much.,
Because I’m incredibly rich and I get driven everywhere.,
Yep. I’m loaded beyond your wildest imaginations. How much farther?,
"Yeah, if you could fucking walk, you should kidnap me.",
Oh you know a house? It’s all coming together. A place to fucking keep me?,
"Hey, what do you care?",
I used to be an addict. But not now.,
Hey.,
Fine. Tough.,
Uh-huh.,
Great.,
Great.,
"Right. Yeah, well. You know?",
No?,
"Well, good.",
Mom? No.,
C’mon.,
Hey.,
"Hey, Con. Good fireworks?",
Yeah good one. You know. I’m sorry. I am sorry. Hey hey hey? What are you two doing up?,
Look at you two!,
"Well, okay.",
Hey. You good?,
Good. Okay.,
Huh?,
Really?,
"Right. Oh, good. But he died?",
Wow.,
Hey.,
Uh-huh. You know?,
Right.,
"Oh, that’s terrible.",
"I knew – I knew – I know, since, I just heard. But it’s a shock.",
Oh? Maybe he – maybe – maybe he—?,
"Um – what, as in—?",
I don’t think so?,
Um—,
Right?,
Right.,
Right … Dad—,
Um – I – I don’t know?,
"Um. Right. I mean, nobody did anything wrong and – you know. It sounds like. So?",
There’s nothing— I don’t think. I wasn’t there. So?,
"Waystar, plant a flag, fix on my lawyer, PRs, get some independent directors shaking, and maybe right in to see the fucking feds?",
"Well no, because I was acting in the best interests of the company.",
Continuing in silence was untenable from a legal and moral point of view.,
"This –  is Waystar now. Look. I need a sealed unit here, Karolina. I need a clean jar. Are you in for this revolution?",
"Hey. No. Keep looking at me, okay? Don’t answer the phone. Are you with me, yes or no?",
"You’re at a fork in your life, Karolina. Do you want to join the good team? You know he makes jokes about you? Do you want to hear what he says about you? He calls you the ‘Sausage Grinder’ and—",
Do you wanna be able to look your kids in the eye?  is the righteous vehicle.,
Okay. Stop the car.,
"Out. Please. I need to make calls. I can’t have weevils in the fucking flour sack, okay? Out. Now.",
Everything you’ve heard today is privileged. Repeat anything and I’ll sue you out your ass. Goodbye!,
Good kid!,
"I think I want Lisa Arthur as my personal lawyer, but can you call Remi to hit me up with other names?",
"Greg – if I get taken out on other shit, I might need you to take my cultural temperature. Okay?",
"Before I get my media monitoring in place you might need to slide the socio-political thermometer up the nation’s ass and take a reading, okay? I’ll get seasick. Feed me the metadata, anything that’s going to move the market on me reputationally, yeah?",
"is telling me Lisa Arthur. Did you get her avails for me, Jess?",
"You’re my ear. I should know what he’s saying but I’m not sure it’s wise for me to hear it, legally.",
Is it him?,
Just – listen.,
What’s he saying?,
Is it bad?,
Tell him legally it’s not wise for me to talk to him. But I’m going to be in contact with the government. This would be a good moment for him to step down.,
Okay? Well tell him I’ll run up off the fucking beanstalk.,
"He should step back and cooperate. I don’t want to see him behind bars. He may no longer be a father to me, but I don’t want that.",
What did he say? Any actual physical or legal threats?,
"Hey. Frank? You don’t need to speak. I just want to say. Sorry I didn’t talk to you before but I just want to let you know – you just need to tell him time’s up, okay? He steps back and we can cool this down. Someone like you steps in, lot of respect, you know? Lot of folks would put in a shift for you? Steady the ship together. I did this for you, man. For the old guard. This is exciting, Frank.",
Gerri. Get me Gerri.,
"Oh, Shiv? Shivvy? How you going there? You ready to come over? I got a spot for you? Everything’s coming up roses, Shivvy! Just stay quiet and I’ll talk— Okay. Jess. What we got?",
But is it positive?,
"Nay? Hey. I’ve got a million calls, but I wanted to say hi.",
You’re on speakerphone.,
Fuck you. Because it’s – simpler. Did you see it?,
Yeah fuck you.,
"Okay, ‘hahahah’, sure. But what if I am?",
"Sure, sure. But joking aside perhaps I am though, have you considered that?",
Nay. I’m arriving at Waystar. Can you come see me?,
"Later, Nay. I love you. Well, they can’t.",
"Do I want pictures of me not being let in? As my next visual? Fuck it, keep driving. There’s press at my place, yeah?",
Hey?!,
I’m good. I’m good. Yeah.,
"Yeah, well, it’s been in the mail.",
"You know, you always said— So. It was either this, or you know, go to Mount Athos and become a monk.",
"Press are swarming my place and I need a hidey-hole. Plus I actually just wanted to see you and the kids? You know, I – kind of, I mean, it was kind of for you guys?",
Is it okay if I bring in the guys?,
"They’re legit, right, Jess? All the Emirati use the firm.",
Is this okay? To do a few calls? I wouldn’t ask if I had options?,
"Thank you. Thanks, Rava.",
"Whatever, I don’t know. I mean you might want to watch it. I’m talking to Lisa Arthur?",
Yeah. Well. Do you think it’s going to work? Can I win?,
"Hey, hey, hey! Berry fucking Schneider! Come in – sit, sit. How you doing?",
"And I’d love to work with you, but if it’s cool and I know you guys are the best, but is it okay if it’s still a pitch?",
"Great, great shall I talk or will you?",
"Sure, you go. But I think the headline needs to be fuck the weather – we’re changing the cultural climate. But you go.",
"For context, I’m talking to the  about an op-ed. Draft an alternative corporate manifesto. Drop a – rapid-reaction TEDx.",
"It’s cheesy as fuck but, I need people to see this was part of a coherent philosophy, not just punching an old guy in the fucking nose, right?",
"I realize I’m talking too much. You guys jump in, but I was thinking a really significant donation, to a an addicts’ shelter, like today? They’ll hit me with my history in that area for sure. I’m sorry.",
"Yeah well I may as well say, on a dumb level, I’d like my Twitter to be off the hook. This could all get super-earnest, so I was thinking of hitting up some  guys, some  kids to just smash that shit, make my feed a little powder keg people need to check in with?",
Yeah that would be the straight-leg chino way of putting it. ‘Cool tweets’.,
"I’m kidding. I know you guys are the best. I’m sorry, let’s get into this. I want to work with you if you can work with me?",
"Hey Rav? I got more folks? And just as an FYI, is it cool if, Naomi Pierce comes up?",
"Yeah. And you know we had, have, a little thing going?",
"She’s really good for me, Rav. Is it cool? Not weird?",
"Look at us, huh? Ah? And I saw the razors, so, yeah?",
"In your bathroom, whose are those?",
Why? Because – I don’t like to take a dump where the staff go?,
No? Male razors?,
"Oh, so I’m not giving you enough money for gender-appropriate razors now?",
"I’m kidding. This isn’t that conversation. I’m kidding. Hey, Team Genius!",
It’ll just be four or five hours?,
Okay. Incoming. Here she is now! Here she is! Rava – Naomi.,
"Greg – I should, I need to— Can you, help us yeah? He’s still in Europe! He’s scared! My dad’s gone to Sarajevo. Lisa!",
"Sure. Sure. Well, listen, what can I tell you? My dad’s the devil, he runs a crime ring and I would love to hire you because you’re a superstar and I think you can take down my dad and, and this will be the case of the century and the highlight of your career.",
I’m serious. They’ll make a movie about you.  should make a movie about you!,
"It would look amazing, because it would be brilliant!",
Correct.,
Who will play you in the movie you think?,
"Yeah well, that might work out anyway.",
No. And look – to be clear. I will do whatever you tell me to do. I am your puppet.,
"Lisa, I feel like you’re my lawyer? Are you my fucking lawyer, Lisa?!",
We okay?,
What?,
"Take a photo of the label, Greg. I’ll get you a case, Rav. I’ll get you twenty cases.",
We’ll stopper it?,
"Oh, Shivvy? This is it, sweetheart. Tomorrow the wine and roses, but today the necessary murder! Okay! Greg, let’s game a call with your grandpa because I’d like us to get Ewan squared off?",
"You okay, dude? You wondering if you tied your dick to a runaway train here?",
"You aren’t Judasing are you, Greg? —",
My dad get to you?,
"I’m not going to burn you, kiddo. Okay? I don’t even have to tell the government where I got the papers.",
"And I’ll stick by that. Could have come from a million places. I could’ve found them on a photocopier, could have got sent them? You did the right thing.",
"Listen, let’s settle your stomach. Let’s set you up with a lawyer. I’ll talk to Lisa, she’ll give you the name.",
"She’s the fucking best. And I’ll cover that shit off, okay?",
"You fucking piece of shit! Fine. Fine. Look, Greg. I’m pretty sure I’ll be victorious, but maybe not? Go on, take a walk and have a think: Do you want to be on the side of – like, good or evil?",
Okay.,
What is that? A Trojan horse? Is that a joke or—? Who’s the Trojan horse here?,
"How you doing? C’mon, let’s talk.",
"So. So, okay, okay! How we doing?",
"So, I have an offer.",
I’m not going to fuck around. I want you to join me. I want you on my team.,
"Well, I dunno. From his point of view, it made sense.",
"I mean who else was he going to choose? Unless, you know, he took responsibility himself?",
"Yeah, well the situation was the situation. I felt I had no choice.",
"I get it, sis. You’re angry with yourself.",
You know I did the right thing and you’re angry with yourself for never doing it.,
"That’s just what I would say is going on here. But if you don’t see it that way, fine. Shall we talk?",
"Or, I saved the family? Depends if you think the family is Dad?",
Maybe it deserves to be?,
"Well, I dunno, Shiv, maybe don’t let the guys rape the girls?",
"You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one.",
"I have a daughter, Shiv.",
"Shiv – I don’t know. Honestly, I don’t know. People aren’t one thing. I think I did a good thing. But yeah, maybe from a mixture of motives?",
"Well I’m sorry, Anna Wintour, next time I take down a crime ring dressed up as a Fortune 500, I’ll wear a turtleneck.",
"You tell yourself you’re a good person. But you’re not a good person. Right now, I’m the real you.",
Safe. Getting copied.,
"Sure. What, say I had some deli sushi and everything went hazy? Shiv? C’mon, I’m going for this and I want you on my side.",
Well I can’t unless you come on board with me obviously.,
Okay!  we’re talking! Romey!,
Does he know  here?,
Okay! You wanna let him up?,
"You’re the one I want, Shiv. I want you.",
Okay. Jess – show him up!,
"Hey Marcia, it’s Kendall. Listen, I’ve been thinking about Dad and you and I never liked the way he treated you. So, can you give me a call, I think we might share some interests right now?",
I can’t do that right now. I have bigger fish.,
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, let me think.",
"Sure. But like, big picture what are you hearing?",
What if he shuts this all down?,
"Well he might. My dad speaks to the president every other day, Lisa. We might need to call the state police to arrest the FBI, we might need a plan to fly me without a tail number to Frankfurt or Venezuela? I’m not serious, okay, but I am serious?",
"Hey, Rome! How you going?",
"Okay. Yeah. I feel pretty good, certain amount of regret but, you know, pretty cleansed.",
That’s nice. That’s very kind.,
You take a look?,
"Uh-huh. So. Look, can we clean-slate this? You didn’t like how I did what I did to Dad. Sure. Whatever. I’m sorry. That’s for me and him. But here’s the thing: He’s over so let’s work together to take over and help him move on out?",
I’m sorry.,
"So. Okay, it’s pretty simple. Let’s gang up on Dad and take him down.",
"Uh-huh. It came together for me in my head late and— It wasn’t, I mean I knew what I was going to do but—",
"Well, I spoke with a lawyer.",
"Yeah, but they advised, against, essentially. I can’t rehash it all, but I was effectively, acting alone.",
"It was not actually what they advised. But – look – you can think whatever you want, in the end, of me.",
"Oh right. Right? So if I say I’m taking him down and I’m not interested in any deals with him, you call him, tell him and – just leave?",
Connor.,
Send him in. Ideally I’d like to make a media appearance all four of us.,
Okay. Can we close the doors and turn off the devices and get into this? Okay my thing is: If this shit was just epiphenomenal maybe it could be ridden out. But these incidents are symptomatic of a foundational sickness within our father and his company.,
My point is – the milk is going sour.,
"The great whites. From politics to culture, they’re rolling off stage. It’s our time.",
"Big picture. We’re at the end of the long American century. Our company is a declining empire, inside a declining empire, right?",
There is a problem. We are in the richest society in the existence of human history and – our life expectancy is going down. You know why?,
It’s unbearable. What we’ve built. People are killing themselves with guns or dope so fast that we’re losing pace.,
"We’re, you know, we’re fat-fingered fucks and we can only live on cream.",
"So, general analysis: US supremacy is waning. How will it go? Two ways: Slow, then fast. What I think is, within that context, we can become omni-national and reposition. Because actually we are not tied, culturally or physically, so we are actually in a great position to leapfrog tech. Information is going to be more precious than water in the next hundred. Combine all our news operations, become  global news information hub. Amazon is a quarter of a century old. Gates is an old geezer. Detoxify our brand and we can explode. So, are you interested?",
Rome. He’s a central player in a rotten cabal that has eaten the heart out of American democracy?,
Well maybe he should be?,
Maybe. Maybe we’re all irrelevant. Maybe there were always going to be death camps and maybe the planet is going to fry and there’s nothing we can do? Or. Maybe people make a difference? I don’t know. Do you think human beings matter?,
"Fine. I don’t actually give a fuck. You know? I can perfectly well do this alone – I am actually just trying to be open-hearted and, and invite you in here. I mean it would probably be simpler to go alone but I want to offer you a – fucking ticket to the escape pod. I mean you’re happy he went over your head and put in ?",
"Look, this is how I see this: Dad is complicated. He did, or let bad stuff happen. And now it’s a part of us and our sickness, and we have to take responsibility, because we knew, and this is our chance to pay our dues and wash our hands. For absolution.",
Sure. Whatever but—,
"No? The fucking ‘pipeline’? Of sad dancers who’d got used and abused and promised some Hollywood bullshit, we fucking knew.",
"We fucking knew and I don’t like bullshit, okay, I’m done.",
"We knew, the jokes and the vibe, to women and to the fat- asses who took the cruises, the blind-eye and the pay-offs and the hush-hush about Dad’s pals or foreign workers who got crushed like meat in a fucking grinder with zero training and ‘clean out the rats in the hold’, and no it wasn’t our fault, and you wanna pretend, go ahead, but we – we—",
Because he let a gang of creeps run cruises.,
"This isn’t, fucking, this is a sidebar. All I am asking is for us to move forward from a position of truth?",
"Hey Rav, so grateful. Are they back?",
"Great. Um, and just so you know, I asked Naomi to go home?",
"Thanks for the horse, man.",
"Look, man, sorry I couldn’t – you know, fold you in, or alert you on the press conference.",
"So. Look, how does this play from the point of view of—?",
"Yes, I can kill him.",
"Hey. Sandi, thanks for coming over.",
"No, well sure. I guess nor would losing the proxy vote for you or your dad?",
Hey Sandy!,
"Look, so I give you two hours, two minutes or two words.",
Back me.,
"Look, Sandy, we all know you are kind of, not-really-but-yeah- really, doing this, to beat my dad.",
"Sure. Well, the offer we made you in Greece, Stewy, we stick with all that, but plus – my dad’s gone? And when my dad offers you the board seats and all, one way or another, he’s going to sideline you, right? But not me. When my team offers a strategic review, we mean it. So you can call off the dogs. We have a reform-minded senior management who will invite you in with an open heart, unlike my dad who fucking loathes you.",
"My standing is that I am a witness in the investigation of my dad. Most likely, as I see it, he gets smart and steps away. I’m getting my siblings on-side and I think the board will support us. My relationship with other key shareholders, the Ulsterman, Aaronson, is great. So I just think, you know, our time has come, and I want to know when we kick Dad upstairs, we have a way through here that is cooperative.",
I’m pretty sure Dad will fold.,
Okay! How we doing?,
Nope. We give Dad the revolver and show him to his office. The proxy battle is over. Sandy and Stewy would back down. I’ve spoken with them.,
No vote. We’d have a settlement.,
"I think if Dad went fast, yes. Look. I dunno. I dunno what I think about Dad. I love him, I hate him, me and my therapist can work on that. But he was gonna send me to jail. You know? He’d do that to you, Rome. And Con. Shiv, I dunno – I dunno. Maybe. So. What do you owe him here? Really?",
"Well, we’re looking at three-twenty-three BC.",
"Alexander is dead. I take Asia, you take Egypt, Shiv takes Europe. Con, rest of the world.",
"Separate divisions. I could oversee, as CEO on paper, as we shift to these spheres of influence and evaluate what is core as we move forward.",
I’d offer my leadership initially as a necessary part of a transformative process.,
"No, because you don’t have the experience, so that’s not possible right now. I wish it was, but it isn’t.",
You’re too divisive. You’re still seen – I don’t see you this way – but you’re still seen as a token woman wonk woke snowflake. I don’t think that but the market does.,
Interim chair. New directors. Clean broom. And then we can figure out how to split the spoils?,
"Fine, take five, take a moment.",
It’s fine. He’s gonna know. Of course he is.,
Shiv? C’mon.,
"Okay, these are irrelevant. So—",
"So, you wanna—? I’ll make the call. Right now. We’ll say it tonight. It’s over. We’re in. New dawn. Con. Stop looking at the fucking donuts, man. It’s – just— Okay, focus.",
Well fine. You’re irrelevant.,
Go on. Go.,
"You’re not wanted. You’re not wanted, you’re not wanted, you’re not wanted.",
Rome?,
Why?,
"Like? What, you think I can’t win? No.  win. Come on, man, what I eat don’t make you shit, there’s enough for us all.",
"You’re a fucking, moron. Shiv.",
Why?,
Why?,
"Well yes you do. Have you been spooked by fucking donuts, that’s pathetic, Shiv. You owe me an explanation.",
"Why? You don’t believe me? Obviously, you believe me. So you’re literally choosing the wrong thing over the right thing? That’s what you’re doing?",
"There – are, times, to be someone. It’s high tide.",
"Is it cowardice or avarice? I’m intrigued? It’s because you don’t take over – is that it? Well, good luck with sleeping on that, Shiv.",
You’re a piece of shit.,
"Yeah only cos you’re the girl. Girls count double now, didn’t you know?",
"It’s only your teats that give you any value, so you know. You’re calling it wrong. And you’re fucking over the victims and you’re fucking renewal at the company and and therefore in the country and on the planet. So well done, dipshit.",
— Yeah it’s a shit show over there apparently.,
"Oh yeah, advertisers bailing. Gerri Kellman in charge? I’m sorry, Gerri’s great. I actually love Gerri. But Gerri is a time- server who’s way out of her depth. Meanwhile, the DOJ and I are in contact about the terms of my immunity deal. So, yeah. Does not look good for them.",
"As we said – all that’s on background I’m afraid, lot of moving parts. But please – let’s dive in!",
So will this be in the piece? ‘Kendall Roy ordered a Cobb salad and picked at it inquisitively’?,
"Not really. No. I dunno. Maybe. Look, I come from a world of, of image. That’s the family business I guess. But the path I’m on now is about saying, ‘You know what? Let’s cut the bullshit. This is me, this is what I believe.’ That’s the new image I’m selling.",
"Great. I’m not trying to prove anything anymore, right? Did you see the Sophie Iwobi monologue?",
"Yeah she did a bit – ‘Oedipussy’. Funny right? But it doesn’t hurt now because, I am who I am. And I have an aim or mission, to be like, if it doesn’t sound too naive, to be – good. And to plant a flag – I want to physically get in and plant a flag for that inside my family’s business.",
"You know, sure. There are issues but – essentially, yes. We’ll always have our connection. I’m just really happy in my headspace. And I hope they’re happy in theirs?",
"Fuck it, man. You deserve it.",
"Okay, Reece, shut the fuck up, are we ready? Ladies and gentlemen, because it is game time! And the game is … Good Tweet/Bad Tweet! You crazy fuckers better have these ready when I call them out. You ready?",
"Okay, aaaaand … GOOD TWEET!",
"Boom! That’s that shit! All right, all right, all right. You guys ready? BAD TWEET!",
"YES! Love it. LOVE IT! Keep ’em coming, motherfuckers. GOOD TWEET!",
"Oh hells yeah! Booya! Yo, what time is it y’all?",
"Hit me, yo!",
Boooooo!,
That! One! Sucked!,
What? You guys are mad at me now?,
"Uh-huh, I just think that’s a really lame strategy.",
"I’m kidding, no, I say that with respect, because I want to be real here, because it’s an honor to have three totally badass women in my corner. Which sounds corny, but whatever. So.",
Lisa lawyer. Who I’m paying? This is a full-spectrum situation okay? The legal theater is maybe not even the main theater. I dropped a bomb. The whole world is watching for my next move. Hey. Nice huh? Your natural habitat?,
You smell crazy good.,
"You know what, it’s actually cool to be with people who give a shit.",
"Ooh, Ms Cool Girl’s seen it all, folks. Can I get a water with cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and maple syrup?",
"Hey. Hey, man.",
Wow I didn’t think you’d be here. I thought the ‘President’ of Waystar Royco would be too busy?,
"I wanted to talk to you, actually, about Gil. Some public questions, someone needs to keep an eye on strings getting pulled. There has to be proper oversight.",
"So how is he? Is he all, like, angry hog at the state fair, rolling in shit and snapping at kids?",
Let him worry.,
"Uh-huh. Well, maybe. I’m not a suicide bomber. I wanted to say, um, just – at Rava’s, I think I’m right, I am right, but, I maybe threw a couple of ugly rocks in there.",
I’m just trying to be – thoughtful now. So.,
They made you get all dressed up for this?,
"Look at this. It’s you now. I’m sorry for you, Siobhan.",
"What? No. I just said I’d hook you up, kiddo. What? Don’t get weird. I’m not the fucking sugar daddy, cheapskate! Hey! Hey hey! Guess what, Sophie Iwobi did me again tonight!",
"Yeah, she did a segment. Tore me one! ‘Oedipussy Two’, this time it’s a whole seggy! Okay, c’mon, buckle up!",
"C’mon, fuck that, we gotta see this!",
Ha! Okay! Ha!,
She’s good. That’s fine. That’s route one. But it’s good.,
"That is from Joon’s Insta. I think I should go on. Comfrey, can you touch base? What do you think? I think I go on.",
This isn’t backlash.,
Hey. Jess. So I’m going in.,
Now.,
Lisa! The Regal Legal Eagle. How you doing your majesty?,
I can’t let him dominate the battle space. Wheels are moving. My sister is grabbing the crown and I can’t just watch it happen. What’s the story on my immunity?,
Uh-huh. But we’re losing the momentum. What about a raid? Can we get a raid?,
"Hey, how are you? — FRONT-DESK SECURITY GUARD Sir, sorry. Um. I’m sorry?",
Oh yeah? Yeah? FRONT-DESK SECURITY GUARD Your keycard has expired.,
Expired? That’s weird.,
Oh is it?,
"Not going to the satellite office, thanks. My card doesn’t work, so I’m gonna hurdle the gates there and have Remi film it?",
You guys wanna sync up? Cos they said—,
"Sorry, who’s telling you? FRONT-DESK SECURITY GUARD Don’t let him up!",
This is great.,
"Hey. Good to see you, man. Hey, man.",
"Weird, right? How’s it going?",
"Buddhist. Nice. Life does go on, doesn’t it? So what’s going on in my dad’s office? He got any back-channel White House contacts in there or what? I’m joking. You can’t tell me that!",
"Good we can kid around like this. But look, man, you’re in a difficult position. No fun being the last fucking eunuch in the forbidden city.",
"Hey, everyone! Morning. Just want to say hi, no drama. We’re good. Open-door, yeah? No stress, no worries, keep it up. The revolution will be televised! Okay! Here we go. Let’s do it. Does it feel cold to you in here?",
They’ve hacked my AC.,
"This isn’t sixty-eight, no fucking way. This is sixty-five, sixty-two. That’s fine. But this is cold. This is doing a number.",
"It’s cold it’s definitely cold. It’s clearly cold, Jess. No? Is there a problem? SECURITY GUARD 2 No, sir.",
"I guess you can go then? SECURITY GUARD 2 I’m here for your convenience and protection, sir.",
"Well you are authorized by me to fuck off, that would be very convenient, okay? SECURITY GUARD 2 My instructions are to stay with you, sir, for your convenience and protection.",
"So kind of you, man. Remi, I’m airdropping you a shopping list. And we need to figure out how to get rid of this goon for me, okay?",
What? What?,
Excuse me?,
Are you talking to me? What? What?,
What does that mean?,
What time is it?,
"Little yeah. I have this funny bit – this bit about how for the special committee of the board, and the white-shoe firm that will handle their investigation, how my dad’s put pressure on them to hire a firm who will help him cover up and it’s like – it’s like, um—",
No?,
Cool. Thank you.,
"He’s jerking off his invisible friend. So, where the writers at?",
"No, generally, but I knew a guy at the  who knows Dylan. Can I just find them to say hi? I might pitch a couple of areas for the gigglebots?",
"It’s cool, I’ll find them.",
"Here we go, the geniuses at work! Scribble, scribble, write and nibble!",
"Dylan? I knew Pat at the ? He says you’re a funny dude. I just wanted to drop by and let you guys know you do awesome work – very smart, very satirical.",
"And I want you guys to hit me. Just, Rickles the fuck out of Oedipussy here? I can take it. Give me the treatment okay?",
"I mean, so? So, so, what do I do—? What do we do with this? Because, this is actually, really, sort of nothing I think? Fuck. She’s— Do we just treat it like it’s nothing? Because it’s bullshit. Is the world seeing this or just, basically, us?",
Uh-huh. Can we ask them not to use it tonight – will they mention it?,
But it’s private.,
"I think it’s fine – it’s the kind of thing where we just maybe steer away from it, you know?",
Sure. Uh-huh. Absolutely.,
Totally. And I’m game.,
"There’s just a possibility, with all the legal of it, that I might have to bow out, but we’re good.",
"Sure, no, and I’d help with that.",
I know people.,
A name. I can do that.,
"No, I know. You’re right.",
"Okay. Yeah, no, for sure. Okay.",
"More good shit on the Waystar raid. You all seeing this? Berry, can we content farm this with the meme-team? Also, the like is gone again. I think.",
I liked a tweet of my dad as the devil with a trident made of dicks and the like is gone. Maybe they’re sandblasting my likes somehow? I’m going to re-like now with you all present and can we have someone monitoring the like?,
"Look at that. You glad you’re not on their team, huh, G?",
What?,
"Sure. It just means you have weight, bro. You’re an asset, a player.",
He’ll try to turn you against me and that’s fine. Are you going to turn against me?,
"That’s right. Say it three times before the cock crows, brother.",
"Great. Hey, kids? Kids?! Hey, sweethearts, I know it’s an early start for you guys but I just wanted to say thank you for being so incredible through all this. Now I know you don’t want anything, that’s just who you are but— Jess? —",
Yeah—? Fun right? That’s how much I love you.,
"He’s both of yours. He’s going to stay with me here but you can see him anytime. We’ll buy him an iPad, you can FaceTime him. Big big iPad.",
Little Lord Fuckleroy.,
‘Little Lord Fuckleroy—’,
Hello—?,
"Holy shit. Gang’s all here, huh? It’s like the fucking  of broken corporate America.",
"Oh hey, Shiv—? Thanks for the letter. First-rate composition. Really fucking horrible. Yeah.",
Well I hope it was worth it. I don’t know if me and you come back from that.,
"So how’s this going to work, Siobhan? Can I tell  about the infidelities? You still fucking your way around the city like some cum-drunk Ukrainian model?",
"Ha. You sure you picked the right side, Shiv? Ooh too late.",
"Hey. Accountability’s a fucker. The feds find the nipple clamps in your desk tidy, Karl?",
Together? No.,
Well obviously I can’t meet jointly with Dad.,
"Yeah? Skywalker on lead guitar, Darth Vader on slap bass. That’s not a good band, Frank.",
"No. You don’t railroad me. I need to run this by my team. Me and Dad together, the optics are janky as fuck.",
Oh you do—?,
"Ooh nice mind-fuck, Shiv. It’s like you got your wang in my brain and you’re just waggling it about.",
"Oh. Hey, Dad. Come on? When have I ever not behaved appropriately?",
"This just doesn’t work for me, at all. Fuck you and god bless.",
‘Little Lord Fuckleroy—’,
"I don’t get railroaded. Not going. Rabbit-cam, for the kids—",
"Josh Aaronson is a lock for me. He’s always been a lock, right back.",
Uh-huh?,
"They’ll settle, in the end. Right?",
Well obviously I have factored that into my response.,
When and where?,
Uh-huh.,
Yeah—?,
Hey so look I think it’s pretty obvious what we need to say so I’m heading straight to Josh’s compound. Tell Dad ‘meep meep’. It’s Roadrunner!,
Hey! Josh. What’s up?,
Are you kidding? Just had to say the word. How’s Kitty?,
"Yeah, he’s great. I just bought him a giant rabbit. So now he’s googling where he can buy the world’s biggest carrot.",
It’s all good. He had to take a call. He sent me ahead.,
"I dunno, sure. It’s all terrible, it’s all good. You know.",
"We should probably wait for the old man. But yeah, I still love him, I’m still his son. It’s a fuck pie. But it’s not that complicated. I’m better than my dad. But my dad is still better than Sandy and Stewy.",
"My dad or Sandy? Sure. They’re basically the same shitty business guy. But my dad is a smart psychopath who’s off the chart, whereas Sandy is a vengeful little middling prick.",
"Well. The comet is coming but we’re working on the biodome. You’ve seen our streaming offering? Bullshit. Myriad reasons – infrastructure, loss of key talent. But – a single acquisition and we buy in an oven-ready UI. Machine-learning, social media, super-app dinges. We buy GoJo.",
"I dunno, either way, great UI, shitty content meet shitty UI, great content.",
"You know I like you. Outside of all this, I really, really like you.",
Big fucking nervous breakdown of a party for my fortieth. You’ve gotta come.,
"What, you need the list? You, me and Henry Kissinger! Fuck you, I know everyone, it’s gonna be the bomb!",
"Hey, Dad. How was your call? I was telling Josh, you got delayed on a call—?",
Right.,
"Come on, Dad, let’s walk it out.",
You alright?,
I said: ‘Are you okay?’,
I just told him the truth. You’re toast but we’re still the best bet.,
Well I know he’s watching us.,
So fucking lame.,
Love it. Fearless.,
Low blood sugar.,
"Well you know, Beatles put out some of their best shit was when they were suing each other, right?",
Uh-huh. Great band.,
Sadly.,
Stewy’s a great guy but he’s just numbers. He could run a calculus class at MIT but he’d close a pizza joint in a week.,
Sure. Or maybe he falls on his sword and I win.,
Not possible. That destroys my reputation.,
Is this what this is? I’ve been brought out here to be roughed up by the two of you?,
Nope.,
"Are you trying to fuck me, because, I see this.",
Oh yeah.,
Right. But you’ve held our position for a while?,
Yeah I’m here.,
Uh-huh. Absolutely. Be great to get your brain on it.,
"Awesome. Thanks, man.",
He’s fine.,
I’d rather not say. Legally.,
I have – I have things. Emails. Letters of concern sent directly to him.,
He’s implicated. Just riffing.,
Pitching our vision.,
"Right. What? Maybe not now, yeah?",
Lisa – hey?,
I’m nowhere. I’m in meetings—,
I had to be here. There’s a wider view.,
"Well we lose this shareholder, and lose the vote, I’m fucked so —",
Uh-huh. All good.,
"Absolutely, yes. —",
Well that’s not for me to say.,
I believed a traditional whistleblowing process would be subverted. So that’s why I—,
Sure. Absolutely. —,
What what?,
"Wanna rest up, old geezer?",
Nice speeches.,
"Uh-huh. We’ll see. — Retire now, effective immediately, maybe I go easy, row back.",
"Dad. You’re the silverback but I put you in the ground that day and you don’t get to come back, no matter how much you wriggle.",
"Hey, Josh? I think this feels like it’s going to the ocean? Can you drop a pin for them?",
"We’re good. He’s all good. Let’s walk it out. Right, Dad? He’s fine. He’s a bear. Can’t you even fucking tell him you need a breather?",
"You’ve lied so much you don’t even fucking know anymore. Your brain’s scrambled egg, look at you.",
What’s that? I can’t hear you—?,
"Uh-huh. Look at you, you’re six hundred years old and you’ve pissed off your fucking big brother the president, and he’s sending the feds on you and you’re wriggling but you’re in too deep. Everyone knows, and now you’re trying to counter but you’ve put Shiv in there and she’s a fucking dipshit. I hear no one respects her, everyone’s digging her out and you’re losing control and everyone hates you.",
He fucking hates you too. Your anti-Semitic fucking ‘bagel and gold’ bullshit.,
You don’t know what you’re saying half the time. You’re off the pace. You’re way off it.,
Ask your fucking iPhone.,
Okay?,
Catch your breath.,
Dad – come on. Dad—? You okay?,
All good. Are you okay? Are you having a fucking heart attack—?,
We need a cart and a doctor.,
You’re fucking dying here.,
I don’t want you on my conscience.,
We need to get you back.,
"Whoa – okay, Josh—? We need to get my dad back so we’re going to have to leave it there.",
"Oh god, hey, Dad—?",
"Too much sun. He’ll be fine, just a bit too much sun. — But hey, listen, man—",
It was just heat exhaustion—,
"We went for a hike, with Josh—",
"Yeah well, it’s in hand. The vote. Josh is a lock.",
He’s with us.,
"Soph? What’s going on, Wild Honeypie?",
Put Bianca on.,
Bianca. Let the rabbit have some bagel. Those rules are for fuckheads who are going to go to Miami and leave a rabbit with a Big Gulp and a dozen cinnamon and raisin. One won’t hurt okay?,
Shadow chamber! HQ of the hashtag resistance. What’s his ETA?,
"There he is, the panic meister cooking up his sweaty spaghetti. What bullshit you selling me today?",
"He’s not gonna fuck this, is he?",
"Yo yo. Come on in. Welcome to the real annual meeting. Leave your fucking, lanyard at the door.",
"Yeah, well. Without family control I can’t change things. I’m still here for the victims.",
"Whatever, my only agenda today, right now, is to find a deal that works for both of us.",
I’m your most powerful ally in the company. I know your financing’s starting to wobble and you don’t want to risk everything on the dice roll of a vote any more than we do.,
"With a fifty-million hole in your pocket? This has been a fucking march to Moscow. And for what? You want something out of this. And Sandy wants to hurt my dad. So let’s figure this out, yeah?",
I’ve got an inside track with my dad and he’s one hundred percent ready to take this to a vote.,
"Stewy, I know you guys have been angling for a better deal, and you don’t think there’s any risk taking this to the brink, but I know for a fact you’re not going to get one. He’s a psychopathic narcissist and he believes he can take this to the floor, drag back the undecideds with his beefy Logan voodoo and win outright. And, you know, who’s to say he can’t? At this point, it’s managing egos. And if this shakes out – what with the board composition? We could be partners in this shit one day?",
Stewy. Catching some good vibes. Let me know where your head’s at. It’s exciting. Let’s get this done and pop some corks okay?,
"There he is! McGregor. Big day, big dog. C’mon. What’s the mood, inside man? Is my dad bugging?",
"It’s fine, bro.",
"Yeah, man. I get it. I get it.",
"But look, I may have to burn you.",
Yeah. I wanted to get you up and give you fair warning as a pal. That okay?,
Yeah.,
"Yeah, so my dad lands a deal today, that strengthens his position. Lisa says the DOJ is non-committal about the case. I need to throw them red meat. The thought is I give them you, it’s not much but it’s a morsel. Plus it likely gives them Tom, maybe Bill, it builds the pressure and maybe someone flips on Dad. You see?",
It’s not my preferred choice.,
I said I’d try not to burn you.,
"Look, I’m still not saying I  burn you. All I’m saying is I might burn you.",
"You’ll probably be fine. They don’t want to send bottom-feeders to prison, they’ll probably just fuck you and chuck you to get to the red meat.",
"Or, I mean, you drop from the joint defense? I have to monitor the meeting, but I wanted to give you a heads-up. I like you, Greg. I really like you.",
"Fucking Frank. Humiliating. All these years, he still has to play maître d’ at the Bistro of Bullshit. Yeah, what?",
"What kind of sick, call the vet.",
"Okay, so, figure it out. Call our doctor.",
"Uh-huh, where did the plane bullshit come from, it’s petty.",
"Listen, I can salvage this. I’m on my way to talk to them.",
"So what the fuck is going on? He’s squashing the deal? You have to turn this around, right now.",
What’s happening? Is he okay? Where’s his doctor? What the fuck’s going on? What’s that?,
"Right. You’ve all gone fucking Hieronymus Bosch. Listen to me carefully, all of you, this is you throwing it away. You think they’re bluffing? They’re not bluffing, and you’re putting everything I’ve fought and bled for on the fucking edge and I’m not going to let that happen. You understand me? Fucking fix it!",
And figure out a fucking doctor or I’m calling mine!,
"Stewy, call me back. Both ways work here. I can help if you need me to help. But also, you win, there’s options. I have a set of golden keys here. Call me. Enough fucking smiling, get me – get me fucking, rabbit updates, okay?",
"We have the deal, Stewy says. It’s safe.",
"Sorry, do you mind?",
Er no. I have things to do.,
"The rabbit. It’s dead, isn’t she? I know.",
"Oh. Okay? Well, that’s good.",
"Guys, what you did wasn’t wrong. Sometimes animals are weak and they die so you can’t feel guilty about that, okay? But this one is strong. We’ve got to make the world as good as it can be, yeah? Okay? We’re going to have a new president, a new attorney general, and your daddy is going to help clean out the bad stuff and win. But in the meantime we’ve got to be better. I love you. Okay? Shall we get another rabbit? Come on, bring it in. Episode Six",
"Uh-huh. Fine. I mean we’ve done that but, uh-huh.",
Yup. Yup got it.,
Yup. Got it … What’s next?,
"I think I’m good. Okay, fine uhhhh …  approved the illegal payments because I love sexual assault and I love to cover it up. How’s that? Is that bad?",
"Um. Yeah all these are great. I’m good. Thanks, guys, great work. Yeah. I just will privately run the – the timeline at home but yeah I’m good. We’re good, right?",
Uh-huh ‘Hide the agenda.’,
"And so we’re on the same page, in terms of aims, for me, the wish list goes: Immunity for yours truly. Task force for Waystar. My dad deaded.",
"I think a task force in there it’s just very Enron, you know? Huge signal.",
"Okay! Hail, paper people!",
Uh-huh but the papers?,
But an FCPA angle obviates those objections. Right?,
So you’re saying the papers are bullshit?,
"So you’re suggesting that I suggested that, and that was bullshit? quite Well I can reposition the context in the public arena. Maybe I can flip someone up the tree? Ah? I just feel sometimes we’re allowing the tune to be played at my dad’s tempo, Lisa, and I’m not sure why. I have the quote unquote best lawyer in town, I have the best story, I have fucking receipts, excuse my language I’m not angry. But honestly I am a little disappointed.",
Hey. What?,
What?,
"What are you even talking about? What about – um, Rory?",
When did you hear? Was she going to tell her children at some point?,
"Hey, Shiv, is it true? You at the hate-fest fest? Burning books and measuring skulls down in Nuremberg, Virginia?",
Um? No. Not that I can think of now. At the moment.,
Uh-huh.,
"We can say it went badly, Lisa. It’s okay.",
"They spent all day trying to find hairline fractures in my story, meanwhile my dad’s a fucking tsunami of corruption.",
"I know how this works, okay? My dad is drowning them in chicken feed and compliance bullshit, five years go by and it’s, ‘Hey, whatever happened to that big investigation into the bad people? Oh well!’",
These guys won’t even be here in five years. They’ll be at one of the firms who are running this investigation out of my dad’s offices. It’s a fucking revolving door! They’re scared of my dad. They pretend they’re on the side of the whistleblowers but they’re chickenshit!,
Should put a rocket up their asses?,
Well everything is politics. So.,
What? Do I—? What? No. No.,
"Hey hey hey. So. Comfrey. Lisa’s out. Once I sign the new legal A-team we need to get that out with the right context. Okay? Not a big deal. It’s an opportunity. We just flip a big name, it’s all good. Okay. Big four-oh. How we looking?",
"Yeah. You think? Comfrey, is this cool? I mean it’s cool. But is it bullshit cool? How old are you? I love the ideas but are they too narrow? Is it just like: hunter- gatherers, herders, agriculture, cities? Guns, germs and steel? Or – Comfrey? What was the one I liked?",
Uh-huh. I mean I do want it to be a fucking party? Are James Murphy and Zadie Smith and fucking Chuck D gonna come to my antibiotics party?,
And there’s a big wicker white man at the end and we all dance to Genesis or Roxy Music or something fucked up? Will he meet?,
Tom.,
Where are you?,
I might just watch him.,
"So look, I’ve always liked you, Tom.",
"Haha, yeah well me too.",
"But look. I think I can help you, get you out of this mess, where you’re going?",
You know they’re calling you the Christmas tree?,
Maybe? You think? But I think maybe you don’t want to be the chit the company offers up when it has no choice?,
"It is. It’s complicated. But are you interested in an alternative, theoretically?",
"Okay. Well, my case is strong, but— No, my case is fine, it has gaps. But if I had someone who could say nothing gets signed off on without my dad’s say-so. Which we both know to be true.",
Uh-huh?,
"I admire you, man. You’re a long way from home. You’re far from the tree. You’ve played your hand well and you’re sitting at the top table.",
"Sure. Sure, man. The country mouse and the hot tamale. And I suppose you’re just a long glass of water? No agenda?",
"Well. Here’s how it goes. I’ve got new lawyers, who are amazing. I’ve been in to SDNY, and it’s honestly just a huge relief. Don’t underestimate the cognitive dissonance you’re experiencing – lying, hiding. But pretty soon: granted immunity. And you’re not going to prison. Think about that. That’s nice? Right? Check is on me.",
Uh-huh. So?,
"Fine. Okay. I see. It’s tough for you. Shiv seems safe, Dad seems powerful but— You think she’ll still be there, waiting for you after prison?? She’s my sister but, man, my family? You’ve mated with a different species. Patience? Selflessness? Monogamy? … Not so much.",
And how hard did she try and stop you? Did she cry?,
I think she would have cried if it had been her?,
"She’ll respect you. Tell her what’s she doing. Bring her with us, Logan goes down. And Shiv knows who the fucking man is. C’mon, man. Just sack up for once. Nut up.",
So are you really happy to be the Waystar bitch?,
Yeah?,
"Yeah. Funny, right. Good?",
"Yeah I mean, fuck it, right? I think, balls to the wall, just fucking, nut-nut. Pure – excess. Full bore, yeah?",
No?,
"It’s like, just: bleurggh! ‘I’m throwing the grossest, bestest freakout fuckalalooza and it’s bonkers’ and I own it because if you don’t give a fuck, no one can hurt you. I’ve gone Anti- Fragile. I can accommodate anything. If I start second- guessing, it collapses.",
"Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Show me the cross again. Oh yeah. Looks good, Comfrey-dumphrey. Nay! Come look at my cross. Look. Look at this shit. Hahaha! It’s fucking bananas. Zach, look.",
"And what are we looking at, what are the responses looking like?",
"Maybes are nos, let’s not live in a dreamworld. But who’s in?",
Uh-huh and the sibs?,
"Oh! Okay, what is it?",
"Haha, what? Ahab’s back on that white-whale grind?! Oh Jesus. The suspense! Who will gain control of the gold mine, the fucking – Omaha Butter Churner? Who’ll get to print next week’s strips? What shall become of Beetle Bailey? The Battle for Marmaduke is upon us! Jesus. Wait, who let you in? This is friends-only.",
Thanks. You shouldn’t have. —,
"No card? I’m disappointed, cos you normally write me such lovely letters.",
"Well, I’m glad you came. Says a lot.",
Uh-huh.,
"Holy shit. Gang’s all here, huh? What’s this, Con? What happened?",
Okay. But what’s with—? You not staying?,
"Hilarious, right?",
"Well, we’re making Auntie Nora’s Pink Shape for dessert. And Gully Mixture. Remember, yeah?",
So what do you think?,
"What, from a copyright perspective?",
"Roman, relax. Yes – you can take it home with you.",
Who isn’t?,
"Sure, somewhere. Hey I’ve got something to show here. This way.",
What is it—?,
"Yeah so I consulted with Gladwell and Harari, Lovelock and Popcorn and this, it’s pretty technical, but this is the best we could come up with on the likely directions of society so a little dry but—",
"Hey can we take down the crap-sack Connor piece please? Come on, man, unwrap, loosen up. Listen I gotta circulate. Anna will show you round. But let’s check in later, yeah? I’d like that.",
So. Dad’s sent me something for my birthday.,
Yeah. A Trojan mind-fuck. Trying to slip a maggot in the candy apple. He’s offering to buy me out of my share in the company.,
"Two bil? But, it’s a mind-game. He’s worried I’m not gonna let him keep on living rent-free up here.",
"And fuck him! Maybe I refuse to engage. Mind-game that, motherfucker!",
"Maybe, I dunno, maybe I buy you a – a diamond the size of the Ritz Carlton and a few illustrious newspapers – the  and  and the  – and I print a front page of my dad eating dog dick every day for a year. And I’m living in Marrakesh just fucking you and smoking hash and learning how to turn a lathe?",
Do I buy a diamond mine and make it a co-op? Or just fucking – give two bil to UNICEF and make Dad look like a fuckhead?,
"Oh, hey. Okay? You done downstairs?",
"Good one. Hehe. Um, look. I know why you guys are here.",
"Um, sure. Sure. Oh. Except. Um? Actually. Sorry. Shit, sorry, that’s not possible.",
Yeah. No because the thing is. The treehouse is cool. And you’re not cool?,
"No, okay, come in. Just give the password. You do know the password don’t you?",
"No, okay. Okay. NO seriously, guys, come over here. Sorry but joking aside there is actually a real issue here and I need to be discreet but there’s a lot of celebrities around and there is just one significant issue. Which is the issue of— PHEW-WEE! We’re trying to keep the stink out. And you guys stink.",
"I’m sorry. It’s just, if you guys were in the treehouse, it kinda wouldn’t feel like the treehouse, you know? You’re a Nazi lover— and you’re a Nazi lover and I’m a defender of liberal democracy. And this is made from George Washington’s cherry tree, so?",
To see Matsson? That’s why you’re here? For him? You’re trying to push a deal here? High-quality personal conduct. Really top-rank.,
Right. But I have to weigh that against the consideration that ‘no losers are allowed’.,
"Bro, calm down. You’re crying about a treehouse. Do you have any idea how ridiculous that is? Hey, man! Come on in. Wristband him.",
"No idea. Don’t let these two in, okay? This is my space you shouldn’t be anywhere near here! And thanks for the offer, Rome. Really cool, great headfuck from you and Dad, thanks.",
"Okay! Lukas Matsson! My man, my myth, my motherfucker!",
Still not figured out the socials? You should get your algo guy to fix your code.,
"Listen, you know my siblings are looking for you now.",
Emissaries from the Grand Old Duke of Old. Dad wants to buy you so he sent his winged dildos to schmooze.,
"But it makes no sense, correct? Amtrak buys Tesla. If anything you should buy him!",
"Sure. When I’m ready. Listen, stay up here, okay? So you don’t get networked to fuck. What can I get you?",
Well you can’t go. I’m doing a thing. And we got the Tiny Wu-Tang Clan. These kids we found that do Wu-Tang covers.,
It’s better than it sounds. Are you not enjoying it?,
Uh-huh. Savage. What you gonna do for yours? Just Sarah and Orla and some pasta alfredo? Three glasses of Chablis if you’re feeling ‘naughty’ and lights out by eleven?,
I know Gary. Nice little poseable action figure. Does he have any genitals?,
"Oh, okay. Gary’s gotta be fresh for the big meet!",
No. What?,
When? When you arrived? That didn’t get to me. Do you know who you gave it to?,
"Fine. Okay, I’ll find it. I’m gonna find it. It’ll be logged. What did it look like?",
"Alright, got it. Yeah okay. Okay well. Fine. Thanks for coming. I might be getting out, from the firm, so – we’ll talk more.",
Dad’s offered two bil to buy me out. He thinks it’s a fuck-you but I might just take the money. Put it into something better than Waystar. Like human trafficking.,
Hey. Love the shoes. Are you being ironic? Or am I? Can we trace that gift please. Priority one. Who are those people?,
"I wanted nice people who would bring a cool vibe, these – these are not what I envisioned. Can we thin them out? They’re hogging servers. It’s cool but it’s not cool. Are they playing from the approved playlists in the main room because my thing was all bangers all the time, yeah? Plus and this is nothing, but can we get Connor to lose his coat?",
It’s nothing. He’s souring the vibe. The fucking arm thing? It’s fine but— Yeah? Fucking disabled vibes. And he’s making everyone feel cold. It’s not cold. Is it?,
"Exactly so let’s encourage him to remove his coat, if he wants, loosen this thing up.",
Look. It just feels like an asshole’s birthday party. And my one thing from the very first meeting was that it shouldn’t feel like an asshole’s birthday party.,
"Could we lower the ceiling? In the big room? It’s fucking ridiculous in there. Or give the impression at least? And the coat, yeah? Hey, Greg! The snitch bitch.",
"Um, I’m about to do my set. Walk with me – what is it?",
"You were gonna ask Comfrey out? Comfrey, my employee Comfrey?",
"No. And she’s out of your league, man.",
What if I want to ask her out?,
"Inappropriate. But no. It’s best you don’t, okay? Too complicated. She works for me. Clean lines. Church and state. Okay?",
"Yeah, yeah.",
"Uh-huh, you know what? I’m not gonna do it.",
No. It’s bullshit. No.,
Uh-huh.,
"I’m not doing it. It’s overdetermined fifteen-layers master’s degree fucking hokum let’s pull it. Dressed in a tuxedo, nailed to a cross, singing Billy Joel? It doesn’t make any fucking sense.",
"You found the one, from my kids?",
Uh-huh. Well. Okay. That’s not good. Will you give us a moment?,
Uh-huh. Well it won’t turn up if we don’t look for it?,
"I’m sorry, I’m just saying, Nay. So where the fuck is it?",
Yeah. Yes I would. I would love that. Okay. Wow. Wow.,
Yeah. Thanks.,
No it’s nice. It is. Thanks so much.,
It’s great.,
"I like it. Thanks, Nay, is it inscribed or—?",
"Ha. Yeah. No it’s just, why would you get me a watch? It’s fine but.",
No. I don’t want to be a dick but I have a watch you know I have my watch and like— Just another watch.,
"No, it’s just apart from my kids you’re the only person in the world who gives a fuck about me and this is what you get me?",
"Well no you’re not, no, so I’m just trying to get inside your head and figure out why you would give me this gift? It’s fine.",
"No. It’s fine. It’s fine. I don’t know I just thought it might be something. Because I’m you know, I’m spinning, out here. And I thought, I just thought it might be something.",
"Like I don’t know, something, else.",
"I want something that might make things good, you know? Something nice.",
"This is so – pathetic. This – thing is fucking vainglorious bullshit and I – I can’t do it I don’t want anything to do with any of this fucking shit, it’s just nothing and I wish I was – I wish I was home.",
Neither of you should be in here.,
You came here to fuck me. You’re ghouls and you’re disgusting.,
Can we get them out?,
"You didn’t come to see me, did you, Shiv. You came to chase a deal for Dad?",
GoJo was my idea.,
"You like the spying, Shiv? On your niece, on our nanny? You like that?",
You’re not a real person. YOU’RE NOT A REAL PERSON. YOU’RE NOT REAL.,
Shall I tell them to stop the party?,
Not true.,
I have a number of other points to make.,
"Okay. Well, here we go.",
Well what’s that supposed to mean?,
"I’m fine, Rava.",
I haven’t been feeling great. But I’m feeling a lot better. And she’s grabbing some time to check in on herself. That okay?,
"Sure. Look. I have Bianca and I’m fine, this will be good.",
What? I’m sorry? What’s ‘hot’—?,
"Oh, man. Should I take her? Shall I fire her? Why didn’t you call?",
"Is this a thing? Can I just get a read, am I going to read about this in court papers? This isn’t – leverage is it, Rav?",
"Fine. Just, I have a lot going on. I’m going to speak with my father. About— And Naomi. So this just feels like you’re doing a number.",
Okay. I don’t think it tracks … she’s stealing a hundred bucks? She’s on a hundred grand a year. They like her.,
"Yeah, just stripping down.",
You wanted a word?,
Sure. You look good actually. So? What was it?,
Uh-huh?,
As in?,
No go on—,
"And so what is your son getting? And what is your ex-husband, who you hate, getting?",
"Jesus, Mom. I don’t know if that works. I actually was planning on talking, so—",
"Yeah, pleased to meet you.",
"Right. Yeah, I do a lot of meetings.",
"Yeah, I don’t know. I actually might be getting out of the whole business so. Yeah. Spread it around. Mom, I’ll check the schedule, maybe see you next month?",
"Saw it on the plane. You’re such a shitty flack, Comfrey. Requests?",
Uh-huh. Sure.,
Sure. Fine.,
"No. I mean, no. Fuck that why would I give them free content? But keep tabs on that shit. Okay? Fucking bottom-feeders.",
"Whatever, clock the fuck off.",
"Matsson gone nut-nut? Nice work, Rome. Enjoy the ride! Keep hold of that shit, bro.",
"Nah, just my mother throwing me out of her party. Hey, kids! C’mon. We’re heading out!",
"Hi, yeah, I’m gonna get her thoroughly backgrounded. Well, Rav, I don’t want to have to ask the kids direct in case it becomes a thing and they feel blamed and then they don’t tell me shit next time you hire some pedo guy to teach them flute, okay? No I’m not scared. I’m thinking ahead. Yeah fuck you, Rav. Goodbye, I was looping you in but goodbye. Hey, kiddo, listen. So, I’m just trying to figure something out. Your mom says that you said that Bianca has been being weird and taking money and she made you cry? But when I really spoke to Sophie she said maybe it was a game? Was it a game?",
What? Like?,
Did she? Really? Did she make you cry? Ivey? I’m not angry.,
"Yeah I’m okay. Hey, Dad?",
"Yeah well this is all total horseshit. Let’s just have it out, okay? I want to see you, Dad. I want to see you for dinner and let’s just nail this, okay? Eight. On your own. Yeah?",
Sure.,
And thanks for teaching them the nanny game.,
Prick. They’re good kids.,
Hey. I thought this was going to be private?,
Uh-huh? Well. Hang out wherever – you can wait inside. So I hear you were asking all about the menu and my chef?,
Sure. Scared I’m gonna try and fucking Jim Jones you with an olive?,
"Yeah, seems a shame. So we checked in with your doc and got the requirements.",
As ever.,
You think we’re gonna miss our chance to dance and end up going Kodak?,
I’m sure you’ll figure it out. So. Can we talk?,
That one’s for him.,
Inside.,
Sure.,
Jesus Christ. Who do you think I am? I don’t want you dead. I’ll be broken when you die.,
He’s fine. Roman taught them the fucking nanny game but—,
"Shiv and Rome— There was a thing, when— On vacation they’d try to make up shit to get the nanny fired. For a prize or whatever.",
"Look. So. My thing is, I want out.",
Yeah. Yeah. I think I thought I was a knight on horseback. But— Yeah.,
"I don’t know. But yeah, look, you’ve won. I think you’ve won.",
"So I guess there’s a couple of ways my life goes from here: Move to Europe, drink or drugs, do cars or beats. Or I fucking do myself in, mort porte it.",
"But I can’t do jackshit. So, I want to get a premium payout from the holding, two bil. And a chunky asset, something you can realize without shareholder input – maybe outdoor advertizing, podcasts. I keep Fikret, Jess and I’m gone, divested, off the board, complete disinheritance. I won’t even speak at your memorial. We’re done.",
"Well you offered, at my birthday, so …?",
"C’mon. Dad, we don’t want this bullshit forever.",
What do you care?,
"Look. I tried, but— I thought that things had changed. But I’m not as— There’s things you are able to do I can’t, maybe.",
You’ve won. Because you’re corrupt and so is the world.,
"I’m better than you. You’re – you know, I love you but you’re kind of – evil.",
"Well you’re smart but what you’ve done is you – you’ve monetized all the fucking, the, whatever the American resentments of class and race and, and—",
You’ve turned black bile into silver dollars.,
Yeah maybe I did.,
"Fine, you know what, I don’t give a fuck.",
"— Truth, okay?",
Maybe.,
"Real world? When was the last day you had a beer, when was the last time your feet touched the sidewalk?",
"Look, whatever, I don’t want to be you. Let me out? Okay. Pay up and let me out. I’m a good guy.",
I’m better than you.,
You know I’m right.,
"Hey B? Bianca. Can we have that talk please? So, hey, um, sit. Yeah this is a tough one and it’s hard but I’m afraid I’m going to have to let you go.",
You’ve probably noticed the tension—,
"Yeah so, I’m sorry.",
"I can’t really say. To protect the children. But yeah, your references will be fine and I should say I like you, so I’m sorry. Things could just be weird.",
"Why? Why because you’re too hot, my wife thinks you’re too hot.",
"I’m kidding. It’s shitty, I’m sorry, I don’t want to make you feel bad. The kids said some things and now it feels like it’s too weird, around them, okay? So, they need to learn. But, yeah, that’s on me. I want them to be really good people.",
Okay. Bye.,
Hey.,
"Uh-huh, let’s not make a song and dance okay?",
"One too many limoncellos. No biggie. Okay I’m gonna grab the kids. I guess, thanks. I’ll see you around.",
I’m not leaving them with him.,
"Why? No, I don’t drive. Kids, hey! In the car, please!",
"Maybe. I dunno. We might jet. We might go join Nay. I don’t know. She has her own shit but – I might need to get home. I’m talking to new lawyers, so.",
"I can’t say. But, so you know we’re discussing putting everything, all the papers and all my communications for the last five years up on my Insta.",
Maybe I make my life worthwhile.,
"I dunno. Hive-mind it. Radical transparency. So, fair warning. And  might be doing a big piece with me. So. I dunno. Whatever. I’m ready to really get into it all. But. Um, yeah, thanks. Kids, let’s go!! Comfrey, will you—?",
Hey. Hello? So what is this?,
What?,
What is this? What’s the angle?,
Are you trying to shut me down?,
I fell off an inflatable.,
Is this an ‘intervention’?,
Why do you get to do an intervention on me? You need an intervention. You need an intervention. You need an intervention.,
I fell off my fucking floatie!,
"Well, no, sorry, look who’s fucking here? I don’t see it. You don’t have any standing.",
I have to put out those papers in order to complete my exit strategy from the firm.,
"Not true. No, so you can take this little committee of public fucking safety and fuck off.",
"Okay. Look. I hear you. But I feel like everything I have done has been with good intentions. And I do think this is actually about all of you more than me. But listen, I feel like I’m sounding defensive when I’m not – I’m hearing you.",
"Well I know what you would be saying and if you want to say it, say it. But I’ve thought about this all a lot.",
"Pricks. Look. I dunno. Things went off-course, maybe. But can you imagine how it felt? As the eldest son – I mean – to be promised something and then. You know? Just have it taken?",
Con. We’re talking about what I actually lost …,
I thought you ‘loved me’?,
Sorry. I didn’t delay things did I?,
"I don’t— I’m not interested, Shiv.",
I can’t get into this.,
Shiv. I’m not here. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me.,
"I’m just not feeling very connected to my children or my – endeavors, right now. I can’t get one thing right with another, you know?",
"I’m fucking … I tried to do something, I tried.",
"Fuck you. I took a shot and I think, I think I fucking hit—",
"I had an out, I could see it. I could see the waymarkers and – and I dunno—",
But I dunno. I’m not a good person.,
I’m bad. I’m evil.,
I killed a kid.,
I killed a kid and they’re coming for me. They’ll come for me.,
At your wedding.,
The kid. That kid.,
I was in the car but I got out and I killed him.,
"I was high and I was looking for— I was fucked up but I drove, and he saw something and snatched at the wheel and we went into the water and then I left him in there and ran.",
"It’s fucking lonely. I’m – all, apart.",
"Nah. Man, don’t.",
"No, I mean I tried to get him.",
"I dived a few times, I think I did. I did. I remember I did. A couple of times.",
"Rome. Don’t, man. I’m a killer.",
I don’t know. I don’t know what’s fucking … I’m blown into a million pieces.,
‘Sorry’.,
Please. I can’t do the—? He was— You know?,
I can’t talk about that now.,
He calls it loving. But y’know if I call my dick an oboe they still won’t let me in the orchestra?,
"Um, I dunno. I’m pretty— I don’t mind. Can I be with you guys? —",
Yes. A change of control needs a supermajority in the holding company. Mom got us that in the divorce. He’d need us on board.,
He’ll Romanov us. He’ll take us all to the cellar and that’s that.,
And you can’t be the boss of me.,
"He can’t sanction a deal without us, that’s a legal fact. Block him and he’s fucked.",
He nearly fucking croaked at Josh’s.,
Full coup.,
That will be fun. Fucking take Mussolini away in a van to the hospital. Take over the radio stations.,
I can always talk to Frank. There’s deep cable.,
Pass me the shotgun.,
"Yeah, thanks for talking, I just want to triple-check the holding company by-law shit.",
I’m good. You good?,
Been basically planning it since we were four.,
"He’ll pull the dentist’s chair, that’s what he’ll pull. Divide and rule. —",
"Hey, Dad!?",
Hey.,
"You can tell us together, Dad.",
And they take over?,
And what are you going to do with your ‘several’ bil? Put it on a pile with your other several bil?,
And what are we supposed to do?,
No.,
You’ve fucked us—,
Okay. We walked in on Mum and Dad fucking us.,
"Oh, Romey?! Where are you? I can smell you, I can smell your little ratty body, bro! Where are you, Rome, I need to start a business with you, brother!",
Right. How we looking?,
"Hey, guys! (The EconomistThe New Yorker)",
"Um, no. Nope?",
You guys got the brief yeah? And the notes?,
"Not to be rude, because objectively they’re high level. But in terms of what we need, for our new venture? They’re shitty.",
"What ‘what’, I agree, fucking paper-ego man.",
"Well, you’re the bitch. Because you eat dog food and get hard to dog porno.",
Oh ‘traffic’. Right.,
Nothing.,
"Shivvy, are you snaking?",
"We’re two days out from Dad selling. I’ve smoked horse, Shiv.",
"Opiates are nice. Really fucking nice. I need something super- fucking absorbing in my life and if it isn’t going to be this, let me know, right? Because I’ve been flying round the country having serious fucking conversations with serious people, expending serious personal capital on getting big fucking names on board.",
He thinks we’re milk-fed veal and he’s gonna have to run the hard yards.,
"The hundred greatest experts, best writers, top minds, in every field, from Israel–Palestine to new restaurants. One-stop info shop, available exclusively to our subscribers.",
"A trusted hub in a decentralized information market. Farm-to- table trackable, traceable high-calorie info snacks.",
We have the ethos of a non-profit. But a path to crazy margins. You okay?,
Yeah?,
No. Why? Like – what?,
"Where? Oh, man, I dunno. Emotional hog roast. Carnival of mind-fuck.",
"It’s fine. They love it. Get Jess to find them a journalist to burn with cigarettes while they wait. — Shiv, is it a date? You okay?",
"From my team, I got sent— Anne Pierce has been tagged on some girl’s Insta at Dad’s?",
"What, he’s lining up a Pierce acquisition, to add to his little fucking ATN rump?",
Set Tom and Nay up to torture us?,
"Nay-Nay, call me.",
It is actually cute. He’s selling the fleet but kept his little ATN dinghy so he can wear the captain’s hat and go after his white whale.,
Right. What about The Hundred?,
Should we ask Tellis?,
Sure. But—,
Are you scared of fighting Dad?,
"I don’t have a view. All I would say is it’s worth the conversation. It’s our wheelhouse. It’s a Daimler that’s been in the barn for twenty years, clear the chicken shit off that thing, fucking maybe?",
"We partner up? With our name, these fucks here or some other pieces of shit? Our experience? Shiv the yummy dummy Demmy; my profile as a fearless fighter of the good fight; you as the dirty little fucker pushing the filth buttons? Yeah, I think new-gen Roys, we have a song to sing.",
Oh Telly Bear!,
Fucking dollar signs in Bugs Bunny’s eyes.,
What do you think?,
Shall we cards on the table? Because I do like Pierce.,
Fucking ‘Battle Hymn of the Republic’. It’s weighty. There’s a wealthy audience in the alienated center.,
It’s just a check-out?,
"This acquisition would be nothing to do with Dad, that’s completely unrelated.",
"Being rational, Rome, try to put out of your mind the personal concerns, the tittle-tattle, and instead focus on how fucking funny it will be if we screw Dad over his decades-long obsession?",
"Thanks, J.",
Did he ask?,
Hey.,
Nan. Like what?,
So – what do we do?,
And are we gonna talk or just fuck it?,
"Sure, thanks for all the voicenotes.",
"It felt like a legal disclaimer, Nay. Jess boiled down the headlines. ‘Tough time’. ‘Out of control’. ‘Emotional black hole’, et cetera.",
"‘Things’? Things like, me and my personality – my very essence?",
Sure. Me too.,
"Me too. In fact, the good thing about me now is that I’m a fully realized individual.",
You don’t want to just hear the offer?,
"Listen long story short – Nan, you called this right before – Logan wants to take your company and fuck it. He loathes you and he wants to take your properties and roll them in the dirt. We wouldn’t do that.",
He only looks forward. He’s a machine for the completion of aims.,
It’s robust. Tellis and our team can talk to your people.,
Totally. Shall we just say our number though? See if you understand that?,
"Can we go there, T? Eight-five?",
"Thanks, T, good insight.",
"Hey, Tom!",
It ends the conversation.,
Tellis?,
Ten.,
Want to open some champagne?,
A show about politics called ? How fucking confusing is that?,
"Wednesdays, dookie … Sundays,  stinky dog dookie …",
"And not to get ahead of ourselves, but I do think we’re uniquely positioned to ride the macros without also making the American shit-slope more slippery, right? Yay ratings, yay democracy?",
"So, my floaty kinda semi-pitch would be: hardcore, international news. Jess, would you watch that?",
"Like, maybe a focus on Africa. Every day, just: what is happening in Africa. A show for each part: the Maghreb; sub- Saharan, east; sub-Saharan, west; South Africa. I would watch that.",
Point is: global reach. A network that teaches you how to watch it.,
Or it’s ecology-focussed? But visceral and spooky.,
"It kinda is, Rome?",
"Sharks? So, . You’re pitching ?",
Candice was trying to ground us but we’re staying poco loco and thinking we bring in some hot-shit brand guru like Glenn Boeckner to walk us through positioning and also tell us why Candice sucks. Well this has been great. Hasn’t this been great?,
Yeah well there’s no actual need to work in a fucking strip-lit thyroid bunker sweating it with heart-attack men. Doesn’t prove anything. Does it?,
"She’s saying no. Shiv, she’s saying you’ll look mad and desperate. Why not? I trust you.",
"And who are you most excited about never having to see again, once GoJo closes?",
Guys? He’s fucking us. He knows we’re out here making moves and he’s scared.,
Oh this is good. Hats off.,
Dude. Relax. It’s just theater.,
So pathetic.,
"Yeah sure. It’s a mistake, Rome. Clumsy old Daddy. Always getting it wrong. Bye-bye birdy. There goes Daddy. A chopper full of fuckery.",
You know I was talking to my guy and in Buddhism your greatest tormentor can also be your most perceptive teacher?,
Con?,
Uh-huh?,
For what?,
"It’s bullshit, Shiv. We’re done. Yeah? We’ve moved on.",
"Well no. We do not want to go somewhere, we want to go and see our brother. Shiv? What the fuck?",
Different deal. Not relevant.,
We’d have to weigh that against the risk of blowing everything up.,
Stew?,
"Hey. Um. Yeah, hey. Sorry.",
"We’re so sorry, man.",
"Well I think we know, right?",
"I think we rise above it, Shiv, right? It’s annoying. But like, float out baby, we float out. The deal, is the deal. The world likes it, the market likes it. The board likes it, the independents—",
"Let’s give him a drink, sis?",
What’s everyone having?,
Con?,
Well her phone isn’t.,
We can monitor her dot together – get it up on the big screen?,
"Lukas? What’s up, brother?",
"Er, well, honestly, no.",
"Oh yeah. One eye open, bro.",
Uh-huh. Well I can’t give you a play-by-play. But I think you can take your nap.,
"Okay, dude, I hear you, man.",
"Nah, brother. I got you. It’s good. Let’s keep the door open.",
Loud and clear. Loud and clear.,
Hey. What’s up?,
Stewy.,
"Guys, can I show you something?",
"On the comparables. Intriguing, no?",
Rome? Look. I think Matsson has deliberately lowballed the synergies.,
And look. I think I agree?,
Just looking at the numbers. It’s compelling.,
"I’m at equanimity with Dad, this is a business decision.",
Nah. He’s on the hook. He needs scale and who else can he buy?,
"Er, Roman?",
Uh-huh? You not going to read it?,
Can we see?,
"He’s using you as malware, Rome, he’s spying on us because he’s heard about the Stewy meet.",
"No contact, dude? He’ll get his fucking screwdriver in?",
We don’t talk to him until he apologizes.,
We have to trust each other for this to work?,
It’s just – why you holding out? We need to be a three-legged table here.,
Okay …,
Bit warm?,
‘Take care.’,
Me too.,
"Unbelievable. I mean, except that it’s – totally believable.",
"I feel like, we need to stick together and we should push back and you should come with us and put the squeeze on.",
"Exactly, with just a more money.",
You spoke to him?,
"Oh yeah? You got a special thing going on? Is he your snow bro, Ro?",
"Oh is that what he said? Oh well if that’s what he said, it must be true?",
I mean why would he say that?,
‘How much is carpet?’,
"‘No no no, too much, too too much, I walk away now!’",
"Honestly, I think going with Sandy and Stewy is the right thing for us to do, this group. It’s just a move. A delay. A couple of weeks. He’ll get it. It’s what Dad would do in his prime.",
"Absolutely. Totally, Rome. It’s just a play.",
"C’mon, Con. It’s okay. What do you want to do?",
Take it easy. Maybe her phone just died?,
You’re not doing better than Willa.,
What?,
How does he know we’re here and how do you know he’s coming?,
"Relax. This too shall pass, bro.",
"Don’t answer it, Rome.",
Do you think he’ll come?,
Oww shit! It’s the fucking underlings.,
‘All Out of Love’.,
We’re not making him do anything.,
"Might have been a wasted trip? Want to give us a quick blast of ‘New York, New York’ and fuck off?",
"Holy shit, did Dad just say a feeling?",
Oh fuck! Now it’s all coming out! Mr Melodrama over here. It’s like a fucking telenovela.,
That will happen. The fucking. But congrats on losing your betrayal cherry!,
"Er didn’t hear that, Dad. Want us to get the words up on the screen for you to follow along?",
"This deal push could be worth a hundred mil to us, Dad, how many apols do we get for that?",
Ignoring Connor his whole life?,
Hitting Rome when he was a kid?,
Having Connor’s mom locked up?,
Is this for real?,
‘Had’? When.,
Can we talk to your doctor?,
Classy.,
It’s just good business sense. Got to make our own pile.,
Amazing. Just over too soon.,
How you going to vote ‘no’? I might bring one of those Alpine horns and do a: ‘Nooooooooooooo!’,
"Kidding, Rome. Kidding, man!",
Yeah. Shame.,
Yeah?,
‘Kidneys!’ Hey. Can we go?,
Congratulations. How’s the groom?,
"Um, I believe, when they told Connor his mom was getting you know taken into, to—",
"— into mental health care they gave him cake. Dad and whoever, to calm him down. Dab of sugar, bite of cake. He was eating Victoria sponge for a week straight.",
Unbelievable. Can you believe this guy? So what are you hearing? Is he coming by?,
Oh? Okay? Matsson wouldn’t fix it with him on a phoner? He’s flying over?,
"Get your nose out of our trough, Greggy!",
He’ll improve the offer is what will happen. Dad’s gotta go fucking lingonberry picking with Matsson. We’re puppet-mastering the old bastard!,
He’ll land it. And we’ll pocket that sweet bonus loot.,
He likes you.,
"Fucking bossy boots. ‘Umm, drama! Is there some for me?’",
What? Okay?,
"Who’s with him, what’s going on? What happened?",
You broke in?,
"Oh fuck. What, is he – [talking, can he talk?]",
Has his heart stopped?,
"Well not unless his heart has stopped. What’s going on, Tom? Who’s in charge?",
"What is going on – ,Tom?",
Who is medically competent there?,
Can we be looped in on that?,
What’s that?,
"We  heard he was breathing. You shouldn’t do CPR to someone whose heart is going, Frank, what the fuck is going on?",
Can he hear? Can he hear?,
Can he hear? Does he know?,
Am I by his ear? Dad? Are you awake? Am I still by his ear?,
"Okay. Dad? I love you, Dad. I love you. Okay? It’s okay. I love you. It’s okay. You fucking— I don’t know. I can’t forgive you. But it’s okay. And I love you. Can he hear me?",
I didn’t know what to say.,
"Shiv, Shivvy honey … I’m sorry.",
Dad’s in trouble.,
"He’s on the plane. He got sick, they’re doing chest compressions.",
"I don’t know everything. He’s with Tom and Frank and Karl and they’re on the line to doctors, I don’t know, he was in the bathroom and he had trouble breathing and they’re doing chest compressions and he was still breathing. But it’s looking very bad.",
"Hey. Can she do it, can Shiv speak to him? I’ll put her on.",
But is he okay? Is he okay at all?,
"Can you put me through to the flight deck. Can I speak with the pilot please? I’ll call Frank’s phone and he can take me through to the flight deck, okay?",
"Jess. I need a few things, my dad’s dying, I’m just gonna do facts okay, I need my doctor and— Do they have his doctor?",
"And Dad’s doctor – Doctor fucking – Judith get that lazy bastard and get him and get the best heart doctor in the world and the best airplane-medicine expert in the world and get them conferenced in and waiting and send a conference call number to me and to Tom and to Karl’s phone and any or all of those we will take, but I would like that in the next minute/two minutes please, Jess. Okay? — We need to tell Con. Let’s get Con?",
"Can I speak with the pilot, Frank? Are you with the pilot?",
Yes he can.,
What’s happening? I need— What’s— Where’s the information?,
"Uh-huh. Okay. Well fucking, tell them to, tell them to do it, do it . Okay?",
"Uh-huh. Has he gone, Frank? I mean basically, has he— [gone?]",
"Okay. Thank you, Frank. Thank you.",
Have you got Tom?,
"Yeah, um, I don’t know, Karl, they’ll land in, I don’t know what he said?",
"Right. No, that’s right.",
He said he got short of breath.,
"Yeah and— But yeah, I don’t know, Frank thinks he’s gone.",
"I did, Shiv. We did.",
"I’m sorry, we did but— I wasn’t thinking. I’m sorry. I didn’t—",
We don’t know if he could hear.,
Right. Well. I don’t know.,
"You okay, Rome? We’re okay.",
To him?,
You said good things. You said good stuff. It was good. You did good.,
I think so. Yeah.,
It’s okay.,
Con. It’s very serious. Come here.,
"This is private, Con …",
"It’s very, very serious.",
"I’m sorry, Con, let’s just get you here …",
"Everyone says he is, we don’t know. They’re still doing heart compressions.",
"Hey, Con?",
"Um, he was on the plane and—",
"Sure. I mean, he has gone, he has died I think, Rome, so?",
"Sure, I get it, but like, they will know, they will know.",
"Hey, Tom? Fine. Okay. Thank you. They’ve stopped the CPR.",
Is he covered?,
Hugo – Karolina wants you?,
"Hugo, can you find out what the fuck’s going on? Where are we going?",
How do you mean?,
"Who asked them to? That feels – that feels— Right? Hey, Hugo, fuck off and find out what the fuck’s going on with this boat, yeah? We wanna go back. —",
We’re not estranged. We weren’t estranged.,
We’ve all had communications with him. We’ve been tight. Some road bumps but tight. We had a family – function with him last night. So ‘estranged’ is a strong word and not accurate.,
"And, Gerri, in terms of the breathing space, until we have to say anything, we have a bit of time to think, right. Until they land?",
I honestly don’t know how much I can get into this. How long till they land?,
"Look, this is very surreal. And, not to big-brother it but, just for our own sakes to say: everything we say and do today is going in the memoirs, the bios, it’s going in the fucking Congressional Record, it’s coming up at board meetings, it’s going in SEC filings, it’s – like— We tell them to circle for half an hour so we can get our heads straight and then some fucking rumor starts, we get crucified for being cold-hearted or I don’t even know. Grassy knoll. We are highly liable to misinterpretation. What we do today will always be what we did the day our father died. So, let’s grieve and whatever but – not do anything that restricts our future freedom of movement. Is that cold? Am I being cold? I’m not. I’m broken-hearted. But – you know? I’m thinking of all of us.",
You did.,
Yeah you asked if it was Mom.,
"We’ll be okay, we’ll get people. We’ll get a funeral off the rack. We’ll do Reagan’s with tweaks.",
So can we make it till the markets close?,
"Um-huh, thanks, Gerri.",
Uh-huh. Rome?,
"Sure. Uh-huh. Do we— Maybe we do let them pilot this, and we just take a day or two out?",
Yeah. Yeah?,
"I can’t think. — Okay. But just to say, we give control to Gerri and Frank and Karl and Tom and Karolina up there— I don’t know. I don’t really want to be the one to have to say things, I feel like you’re looking at me, and— Yeah. But.",
"I mean, who knows, maybe we, tomorrow hand them the crown, probably a good idea. Finish the sale. Great. But, just should we keep our options open?",
"Just for the statement, Rome. It’ll be for the board to decide. But I think until then, for the markets, we need to be in control. Us.",
We’ll draft the statement okay?,
Yeah but we’ll draft. It goes: the sad news. Board will meet to discuss leadership.,
Think he’ll be okay?,
It’s fine. And what did you say about the deal?,
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You said full steam ahead?,
No it’s fine.,
"No. It’s fine, I’m sorry. It’s just the day. I’m paranoid. Dad is dead and I’m paranoid. Okay? It’s all good.",
We’ll be okay. You’ll be okay. —,
Well you’re fucked. You’re totally fucked.,
Do you want to?,
I’m gonna watch him down.,
I think so. I don’t know. Um? Yeah. I dunno.,
"That’s kind. But I think, too much – too much, spaghetti, yeah?",
"Oh, hello, hi Marcia?",
Um. Thank you. Likewise.,
Uh-huh. Right. And where have you— [come from?] When did you get in?,
Okay?,
"Okay? I mean. I honestly, I didn’t think you guys were – you know—?",
Right. Okay? Well …,
Hey. —,
Hey.,
What’s up with—?,
"And, like, where’s, you know, Kerry?",
"‘Intimate calls’ every night, did you get that?",
Yeah? I feel knocked out. I don’t think I slept.,
"Okay, dude. Well, congrats.",
"Well good for you. I mean, I don’t believe you.",
What’s the schedule?,
"Right. Or COOs, I guess?",
Thank you.,
"Hey this is Ken, come on, man, we dropped a call because we wanted to all be on, out of respect, can you grab him? It wasn’t a power play.",
"But listen, seems like maybe this retreat has come at a good time. You guys get your ducks in a row we do our board – pick our captain, and we can reconfigure in a week or— —",
Oh. Okay. No. Nor us.,
Go sell the company in Europe. Good way to stop thinking about – pulmonary embolisms?,
Where’s that from? How many times did Dad laugh?,
I know. He was a great businessman and a great father to boot.,
"Me? Er, acute grief. Crying. Keening. Couldn’t sleep. I actually managed to, in the middle of the night I tried, I did one, talk. My therapist recommended someone and I got to him and he’s kind of good. I have his number if you want? It’s dumb, but there are actually things you can do. One important thing is – is – is, not for now, but is to progress, eventually, to the integrated grief stage. And not get stuck in a spiral. —",
"I have a great grief guy, fuck you.",
"Um, bullet points: helps to talk; get a dog; say their name; you can’t get over it, you have to get into it.",
"Thanks, Hugo.",
What?,
Uh-huh?,
"Did you speak to her, on the day? What will the phone records say?",
Oh Hugo.,
Uh-huh. Threw phones at underlings.,
Again racist. Also relaxed about sexual assault.,
Made underlings honk like pigs for sport.,
"Fuck a child? He wouldn’t even hug, his grandkids. atwith",
"Yeah, hanging in. You guys?",
Sure … but effectively—,
Dad was the founder – and—,
"Oh so, he underlined, recently?",
Shiv?,
Are you serious?,
"Sure. I mean, anyone could do that? And since he said, I mean he has said—",
Well it sure as fucking shit doesn’t say Shiv.,
It was in the personal safe. So. Dad said he wanted me to take over.,
What a fucking waste. It was so stupid. He was old. I should have gone to him.,
"He made me hate him, and he died. I disappointed him.",
You think?,
"Is it real, Frank? This?",
My dad wanted me to take over?,
"If I get them in behind me, will you follow?",
"Weird. Like a dog without its person. So listen, guys, what do you think?",
I think on a business level alone we need to have a relationship.,
Shall we talk about that. Up there. Because I think I’d like to talk about that?,
"But, realistically?",
"Shiv, we’re not about to pull the guts from ATN days from the election?",
What do you want? Get Maya Angelou over to read a poem.,
What you reckon about all the almond butter and maca root? She got one in the chamber?,
"Yeah. I dunno. ‘Gurgle, gurgle, Red Sox. Viagra.’",
Shiv. Shall we talk? Yeah? Nothing needs to change too much? Whatever you’re thinking you can say? Yeah?,
"Hey, dude.",
Nope.,
Yeah.,
I know.,
Embolism. Pulmonary.,
You fucking prick. So listen. You gonna do the board call from here.,
Because there’s a piece of paper with me on it. That Dad said it should be me?,
Can you swing in for me? You know me. You know my flaws. It’s short-term.,
Yeah well that was a different time.,
My dad – my dad doesn’t have many limits. For my family I had to back down. There was no card he wouldn’t play against me.,
Well. Yeah. I dunno. He – he wanted to look after me. So. He was a lot of things.,
Yup. Good technique. Kampala.,
Yup. Yeah.,
He had a lot of fun games.,
"Ah, Dinner for Winners. Yeah. Solid game. Fun game.",
My dad had soured. Lot of baggage. Seriously. Kinda gross.,
Yes. Yes I do.,
"Because we were being cut out – behind our backs. We had no plan B. Look. The deal has to happen. We can’t live in a haunted house. I have plans, with the sibs, we’ll take news and maybe fuse with Pierce. But it will be a feather in my cap to bring in the deal. Sticking close with you. Yeah? You’d be inside it all with me.",
I’m twin-track. I’m dead but I’m alive.,
"Dude, I have the best grief guy. What am I gonna do, sit in the dark and drink Laphroaig? Matsson will destroy Karl. He’ll probably mort on the plane over. I got this.",
"I dunno, man, like – maybe do a solid for your oldest pal the day after his dad died. How about that?",
So listen. I think Stewy would swing behind one of us?,
"I guess the agenda for me is, do we, you know, do we agree to flying to Matsson?",
Okay. What?,
We’ve got like ten till board time?,
Um. Yeah. No. Swapped messages. Shiv? Shall we?,
Shall we get private?,
"For fuck’s sake. Ah? Come on. We’ve got somewhere. Let’s talk about it, yeah? I don’t even care what happens? But let’s not just give it to fucking Team Viagra because we didn’t talk?",
So. What do you think? Do you have a problem with me? Because. Yeah. That’s fine. But I’d like it to be one of us – and – yeah? Dad said so.,
"All I am suggesting is I swing it for us and then we move ahead, us three, Pierce, ATN.",
You’re not pulling for Ger-Bear?,
"About me, dude?",
Uh-huh? Okay?,
Well that’s ultimately how I want it.,
That’s an asset. Fresh blood. I’m the clean broom.,
"That plays, Shiv, it does. With the board? Same-old but with a vibey new banner.",
"Uh-huh. I see that. I see that, bro.",
"Yeah. I mean, Rome. It doesn’t have to be just me. I’m down. I’m down. That makes sense.",
"Well. Yeah. Honestly, I just worry it looks like special pleading. It’s the COOs? It’s in the draft plan. I’m on the piece of paper. It needs to look dry and clean and tough.",
"No. Really. Shiv. It’s not. I don’t think it works, you actually don’t have experience. It starts to look flaky.",
"That was Daddy make-work. And besides, two is cool but three is – three is –",
We’d only be fronting it.,
"Really it’s the threeby, it’s the team.",
"It’s a holding position. It’s holding. We’ll do the deal. Spin ATN, fold in Pierce, six months, eight months?",
Equal as fuck. To the gram.,
On yesterday.,
Thank you.,
I’m sure he’d be appreciative.,
How do you know?,
Uh-huh.,
"Well, we insulate our people.",
Uh-huh?,
Nah. Nah.,
Just you and him was it?,
"Easy, tiger.",
Uh-huh.,
Look. It’s simple. COOs are on the draft emergency plan. It looks perverse not to honor that and it looks pointed for it not to be us. Me and Roman step up.,
But we spoke frankly.,
"Uh-huh. Yup, all the better. It makes perfect sense.",
All because I blew the whistle.,
"I want to do the deal and get out. We’ve got our own ideas with ATN refreshed, there’s a shape for things for us, we have things cooking.",
Er yeah. Yeah. I guess. I think I did? He did them.,
Go on.,
I think the piece of paper is strong.,
"Yeah. Right now, I would say, considering our dad has just died, we should maybe not shit on Dad?",
"So, Hugo. You know the stuff?",
The ‘Bad Dad’ stuff?,
It’s what he would do. I think he’d want this. For the firm.,
So action that. But – soft. No prints.,
"Nah, pal. Nah. Down-low. You get on it. Not unless you want me to pull out the strap-on? *  In the edit, a moment of Kendall totally alone felt more eloquent. †  As with Kendall, it felt more appropriate for Shiv to be alone in this moment. ‡  This is a joke I tried to get in a number of places, including season two, episode eight, but it never stuck. §  We really wanted to see Mencken this episode to tee him up for later in the season, but in the edit it became clear that though the moment was fun nothing really . So the brutal logic of the edit determined it had to go. Episode Five",
Rome said he’s in?,
And these are?,
"Rome, come get your dopamine topped up. Thanks, all. Sad times. Exciting times.",
Get any sleep?,
"Uh-huh, what you think? Old Guard, loading us up with human listening devices? Look at you fucking chumps! This the Romey A-Team? What’s shaking? You camp out overnight?",
"So what’s bubbling? Don’t crush us, we have infinite deal variations loaded, just short-range top lines.",
"Uh-huh? I mean? We okay it, yeah? We’re balls deep already?",
"And you got my email on Matsson angles, deal thoughts?",
The last one – ‘ignore previous emails’.,
Yeah?,
Talk on the plane?,
"Nah, Gulfstream.",
I know. I saw his handwriting on some deal materials at three and it spun me out so – yeah.,
"Nothing to celebrate, but thank you.",
"Okay. ‘We trust you absolutely, now tell us every single word you plan on saying to him.’",
"Then: go for the bump the board has requested, which is obviously more challenging given the price drop we suffered post-Dad.",
"We want to knock this out of the park. We talk the deck. Parks, sports betting, Living Plus driving growth. There’s a path here for us to squeeze an extra three, four dollars a share. Rome and me. Shiv on point here to advise and liaise?",
We’re finding out who had the worst Woodstock.,
Hugo? What is that?,
Freak out? Why?,
What is it do we think?,
"What does it look like if we say no, we don’t play that weak?",
They refreshed it.,
"I think, with the extra names, we have to be on the big boy. Unless we wanna fly scheduled?",
"There’s like four, Rome.",
Jess! He’s— We might wanna—? Wide necks. Carafes I guess.,
It’s wastewater. I’m sorry I have to focus. Studio overages.  . A hundred and seventy-five mil sunk cost.,
It’s a fucking sleepy robot in a cave. How is that a quarter of a bil?,
"Hugo! If someone’s briefing anything against Dad we’ll fucking crucify them, okay? Rat-fucker Sam. Okay? Rome, let’s do the Matsson dossier together for angles. Yeah?",
We’re death wrestling with ogres.,
"You know one thing? If you want, just to mention, we can cut Tom’s throat anytime you like?",
You clock that he’s a movie guy? We might need a line. In case he queries the fucking cash-incinerator that the studio is right now? Dude?,
Nah. He’s just a guy.,
"I dunno. Maybe, little bit.",
Where are they? What is that?,
Like the merch?,
Is yours small. It looks small?,
"That’s the whole thing. Right? Bring in an offer lower than one- four-four net result: unhappiness. Over one-four-four, net result: happiness.",
"Aiming for one-four-seven, hoping for one-four-eight. What with everything, would settle for one-four-five, one-four-six. Right? That’s the whole of the game?",
Can’t he just figure it out? Is it just drama? I bet it’s just drama.,
"Anything you need. Con. You’re empowered. No recriminations. Sure, if you need, send photos.",
Hey. Keen to get into it.,
No sudden moves. Don’t fart.,
"No, sure, sorry, man.",
Should we sit down somewhere and talk—?,
So. What the fuck is this place? Ten K wedding mill for lawyers’ daughters? Family shots by the window?,
"And regained ten Monday. Logan was never going to be part of the company going forward. In a valuation sense, his absence is not relevant.",
"If you were willing to pay one-four-four yesterday, shareholders won’t like— [you looking opportunistic.]",
"Oh yeah, really good. Funny shit.",
The price is what?,
"Yeah, man, sure, sure.",
"Yeah fuck off, dude.",
"This is a material change, we’ll need to talk to the board, bankers will need to update their analysis.",
Yeah. We say.,
He’s an asshole. He tried to dominate.,
But we need to run through it first and make sure it’s real. We need to talk to the bankers. We need to huddle.,
"It felt like he was trying to fuck with us, right?",
Do you like him?,
Who cares? What do want?,
That’s not okay. Rome?,
"Shiv, we can— We should get into that. It’s not okay. But. We do need to focus. Big picture, we should discuss. What do we think, on ATN folded back in?",
"If we don’t own it, we can’t change it?",
I do think we maybe need to stand up to him? He tried to big- dick it.,
"We can’t go in thirsty. He needs to know that if there’s no deal, we survive. Thrive.",
We can’t navigate by Dad maps. He’s not here.,
I’m sorry. Shiv. I’m just—,
Maybe that’s enough pulling the legs from spiders?,
"Nah. No thanks, man.",
He’s good.,
"Enough. Yeah? It’s fine, I’ve just seen enough of that shit. But do what you like.",
"You wanna do this here? Well. I don’t want to pre-empt the board, but my view: it’s not necessarily compelling.",
"Wow. Okay. You’re gonna save our phenomenally lucrative and influential news operation? Thanks, bro.",
"Look, we’re just concerned. About your vision. And with half our value coming in stock, we’re gonna lose a ton of value if you screw it up. It’s complicated.",
"Dude – I think maybe you don’t understand what you’re buying. And maybe that’s why there’s a disconnect here, on value—",
"No risk, no fails. You look at experiences, look at the ceiling on parks, IP-turboed residential from a trusted brand …",
"Gotta say, I just think fundamentally you’re wrong.",
Already rich.,
"So, what you think? How does it feel?",
Because I think I’d like to tank the deal.,
I think – tank the whole deal. Kill it. Blow it up.,
I like running the ship and I think we’re good at it. And I don’t want to stop. Do you?,
He’s a bad fit and he doesn’t get the business and he’s going to fuck it. I’ve seen him up close and he’s a card trick and he’s going to destroy everything Dad built.,
"We sell? What happens. We buy Pierce. Crank it, one-hundred- hour weeks. Grow it to fuck and everything goes right and what – ten years, fifteen, twenty, we build it to Waystar size? Are we really gonna spend all our time building back what we already have?",
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? I’m just worried – can Pinky dance?,
"You like it though, go from fucking weekend warriors, to bossing full time?",
"What would he do? Exactly whatever the fuck he wanted, right? It’s already wobbling. Pushy pushy?",
Oh sure. It’s a tightrope walk on a straight razor. Five-hundred- foot reputational drop.,
"It’s fucking ‘feel the force’ time. Choose your adventure. Full- bore, fuck the living shit out of the thing.",
"Er, Con. I don’t know. Maybe. Can we decide later?",
"Eyes closed, mouth closed, hair – normal. We do not want him looking like he just came off a log flume, okay?",
"Greg, I need some help.",
"I have a contact, they’re calling you on this line.",
"You’re just telling a journalist the truth, which is that nobody’s getting along. Hugo Baker was kind of made to eat poison mushrooms and shit his pants and the two cultures don’t mesh and the deal vibes are bad.",
Shiv?,
Right. Get anything we can use?,
"Pitch is – we retain ATN, and we’ll bite at one-four-six. Or – he takes ATN, but we need a crazy premium. Good?",
What?,
I’m sorry.,
"I— No I don’t, is it okay?",
No worries. Early cut. Lot of work but we’re excited.,
"Yeah, needs to be, strategically. Few issues but exciting.",
"Look, the studio is out of control. It’s a cultural issue. But it’s cool. The fix is easy. We only flag so you know we’re not hiding.",
"No, man. Being open. It’s just on our models and the banks’ models there needs to be more value for the board to get conviction on this.",
"Well. Sure. But they’re skeptical. Also, the pace. We’re worried about the pace. We will need to slow this down just a little.",
There are just a lot of problems is the honest truth.,
"Like I say, that could be an issue. I think we will have to take it easy. We’re committed. But this is a marathon, not a sprint.",
Rome—?,
"That wasn’t the plan, Rome.",
It was dumb. We’re exposed.,
Oh yeah—?,
Excellent. Let’s run the numbers and take it to the board.,
Hey. Okay? You good? Ready?,
"Correct. So. Look, overall, very exciting. Questions regarding his full understanding of the whole business.",
"But. As we are preparing our board recommendation, in good conscience we need to give some – confidential – context to this senior group and seek your advice.",
"On our final round out there, before we elicited the offer. You should know, Matsson – went a, like little I guess ‘crazy’, on top of the mountain.",
I’d call it shitting the bed. Meltdown. Human Chernobyl.,
We’re concerned. Loose cannon. We got the sense of chaotic strategy. Misunderstanding of our business. Where we’re at and what can drive value.,
"I guess the question is, can we recommend a deal with – someone of this – character. Given, everything else and so on? Tweets, drug rumors. Fifty percent in stock – we’re exposed.",
Uh-huh.,
"Okay, I think we feel covered. Just letting you know and we – we move ahead with what we know, yes?",
Sorry we didn’t mention. We were hoping to keep things dry.,
What?,
Hey. Shiv.,
We’re not sure about the deal.,
We were going to say. It was the plan to tell you. We were protecting you.,
"We’re making plans on the fly. Dad. I dunno, we want to make sure we’re not zombie-marching to the funky drummer. Listen, will you help? We need you. He’s not right for us.",
Maybe we can keep it? All of us? And Pierce?,
"Let’s all get up on stage, Shiv. Me and him, on the product launch. Then all three of us. Unity?",
We got overheated. We wouldn’t dick you over. Okay?,
"I think, it had to happen. It was just the timing, right?",
"Does it feel cheesy to alternate? Should we just do block one, block two?",
"Um. Muster a share block? Board, convince he’s a value destroyer? Regulatory shit? Spook him? Hope the price runs away? I dunno.",
No one else to shake out? White Knight? Stewy?,
"Uh-huh and do you think it’s the speech written specifically for our late father or the fact we’re planning to warehouse the elderly and keep them drunk on content while we suck them dollar-dry? Can we flick, J? It is embarrassing. His eye was off the ball.",
"He means mine. ‘Personalized longevity programs’. Is that something? Can we see drafts, J? The material they drew on and the team available for context and color. Get me the double-click on ‘longevity’. I can see everything. Infinite brainbox. Okay?",
"That now? Sprinkle some sugar. Full of confidence in her. Right? We need movement. That’s priority one. Got to up our velocity, man. We can flywheel this. Paint our names in the sky with fire, bro.",
"Break the log jam, get the franchise pump pumping, yeah? ‘Full of confidence’.",
"Shoot it to the moon, Rome. New cowboys in town!",
"The opening remarks are all potato soup. I don’t want all this. But it probably needs to get said. And Jade. Can we get Lana and Hugo on analyst double- check, who’s confirmed? Let’s get Raj primed to throw some softballs.",
Shiv can say this. And this. Let her know.,
Could we build me a Living Plus house?,
"Small, plywood with basic brickwork. Nothing crazy. I could walk through it – ATN on here and my face aging on the wall here. Maybe clouds appear above the house – don’t write this down yet – I saw it in Berlin, check it with— Check it, I have the show in my notes. They can do it. If we can’t do the house, let’s definitely do the clouds. Then we have my dad appear, out of nowhere, boom – hologram. Or we do it with lights – fucking Pepper’s ghost. What do you think?",
"Don’t say no, Denny, don’t say no!",
"Hollywood, though. Right?",
"If we do the house, which I’m not sold on, the house needs to be portable because it needs to not be here until after the intro VT, then suddenly – here!",
Good pep talk?,
"Okay. And look, I’ve been looking through the launch deck. I have a big— I have a thought.",
Yo. Lanko. Follow me. We’re recruiting. Dumb flesh for the room. Henchman shit.,
Greg?,
So. My pitch is. It’s sizable and it’s for our ears only. Maybe not even our ears. We should maybe have our fingers in our ears as I say this.,
"We can trust Greg. Dead under Matsson. Right, Greggy?",
So. I’ve got a thought. If the Matsson weirdo thing isn’t going to play.,
"So. I’ve been through the material and I have a pitch. We make this about us. Show analysts what can do for shareholder value. Unbelievable growth. Drive the price, we make the deal impossible. I spoke to Tellis.",
"If we can drive above one-nine-two, no one thinks Matsson has the juice. He has to walk.",
I think we can get a tech valuation for a real-estate proposition on this.,
"We need to make analysts look at the company differently. This is the killer app. We have relationships with pharma and longevity tech, I think, I think, we fold health, the ARR numbers get explosive. Maximize your physical potential, live … well not forever—",
"Well sure, if not forever, live more, forever.",
"Like a robot please, pitch bot.",
"We can push this to the moon. Big bump, lets us tell a growth story, growth value, in a value company. I mean, sweet potato pie?",
"On projections. Where can we go? I guess the sweet spot would be … right after they get fucking delicious but just before they get fucking stupid? Greg, get Jess. I need a word person to word this shit up for me?",
"Right. Greg, we have a lot to keep on track. Okay? You have to be a big dog and bark for us. Okay?",
"I know, right? Bullshit.",
Very un-Dad.,
You mean life?,
"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Right. Greg – audio-visuals. The clouds, yeah? Chase it!",
"I think we can push push. I think. This is juicy as fuck, Rome!",
"You okay to show face at the reception? Because I’ve got the big eye on. Ball’s looking fat, bro. I can see everything.",
Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Maybe. Yeah?,
"Well, yeah. I mean, right now, it’s kind of all about the moves, so that’s baller for me. Let’s put an end to Joy. Death to Joy.",
Fuck off. Seriously? Shiv’s ?,
"Fuck it, bro. Why not! Drop her in the end zone. Who you gonna fire next, let’s fire them all! Fire Frank! Fire Karl! Fucking eat Greg and fire me, man!",
What if we doubled that? I want to be super-credible.,
"Go explosive, Pete.",
Could that be a thousand?,
"And then the five- and ten-year projections? We’ve got to be credible, Pete. So – on top of everything else— Base-level ARR a thousand dollars per customer. Three dollars per day to live longer?",
"New products and services, machine-learning on the marketing, plus repackaging health data to third parties, easily grow that three percent per month. What does that do to CAGR?",
"Does it make it bigger, Pete?",
"CAGR of basically fifty percent per year? Five years, we 10X revenue?",
No. What’s the biggest headline number that’s credible?,
"You’re talking gibberish, Pete. If it feels scary it’s because the potential is scary, Pete.",
"I need you to be comfortable because the analysts are going to get into us on this? Are you confident? Are these numbers rock-rock-solid, Pete?",
And blah and bing and bing and dong and dang. Blah blah— We got it?,
Uh-huh. Okay.,
"It’s LA, throw money at it. I’m in deep here. Okay? Figure it out.",
"And find us a sound editor and a picture editor and get them papered to fuck, okay? And get this out – get the text to Romey, and Shiv, yeah, I need Shivvy’s buy-in.",
So how we going?,
And this … Is this the house?,
"This won’t be just this, will it?",
How are the clouds?,
But you’ve done the clouds?,
This is— This isn’t a cloud at all. I saw this in Berlin.,
"Uh-huh. Let me think. Let me think. What you think, Rome? It fits, right? Bing, bang, bong. Me, you, me – us?",
"I got them from up here, Rome.",
"They’re projections, right?",
"I’m kidding. We have it. Pete has it. It’s all good. Hockey stick. We’re pushing to the moon! Right, Romey?",
"Hey, man!",
Good good. So shall we run it? We good. I’m not doing the clouds. We’re gonna play an acoustic set. Ken and Rome unplugged? Okay? I think it’s right. I’ve gone even bigger in Colorado. The numbers get crazy good.,
It’s enough to make you lose your faith in capitalism. You can say anything! You got the pages?,
What? What the fuck?,
"This is the – this is the idea though, Rome?",
Uh-huh? You think it’s nuts?,
It’s time. It’s big-swing time. We have to.,
"Oh, man. Man? Okay. What does Shiv think?",
You dunno?,
"Uh-huh. Thanks. Thanks, man. I gotta—",
It’s cool.,
"Karl, man?",
"It is all good. Thanks, Karl.",
Hey. Easy. CEO. CFO. Yeah?,
"Okay. It says here on my words that I’m glad to be – here. And you know, I almost am. Thanks, prompter!",
"How are you doing, Dad?",
"My dad, who’d been around a little bit. Who was conservative on these matters, in terms of earnings growth, has this to say.",
"Detailed financials I’ll leave to Karl Muller, our legendary CFO … But any questions with a broader overview? Um. Okay. Raj?",
Sorry I’m not … I’m catching up.,
"Oh uh-huh. Okay, well, I’ve been busy up here …",
Yeah I know what it’s from.,
Uh-huh.,
"Yes, Lola?",
"Oh, they’re telling me that’s my time. It’s been so fun sharing this. Thanks, guys. And thanks, Dad! Now please welcome, ATN President, Tom Wambsgans!",
Warmed ’em up for you.,
"Uh-huh. Thanks, guys. How are we?",
Yada yada. On the reals?,
"Thanks for the pep talk, buddy.",
"Haha, okay. Climb down! Price rocket! Now we’re talking.",
"Hey, Gerri, listen, thanks, um – do you wanna talk? Should we —",
"Just pleased for our shareholders. Pleased for the pension funds, Ger.",
"Hey. So what is this, because I’m – I’m up against it.",
"I’m fine. We’re all fine. This is fine, but if it’s legal stuff I really need to keep my head out of that, I’d rather our lawyers—",
Is she okay? What is it?,
What did they say? What shirt? What?,
Where was she? This incident? Why didn’t I know?,
And why was she out on the street?,
"I’m just saying like, someone pushed our daughter or whatever, where were you?",
"I’m not blaming you, I’m just getting all the information before I make a decision on our course of action. Where were you?",
"Oh yeah yeah, great. Fuck you, come on.",
"Obviously I feel bad, obviously I will do anything to protect her. I am just—",
Hey hey. Morning.,
Right? Guys? Can we? I have a lot of shit on?,
Seconded.,
Uh-huh sure. I do think – one of us needs to do the sort of – the facts and figures. The official biog and we should—,
I’m easy. I could speak about Dad?,
"Right. Um, one thing from us, Shiv, on the party. We were actually wondering about us, politically, inviting Nate?",
"I think they might just stop it. But even just the threat, creates a ton more risk for Matsson and kicks the deal down the line, right?",
"Can we get him down? So we can sell it, on a real level, without lobbyists and all the—",
"Sure, just it’s delicate. And face to face is so valuable. Election, board meeting? Timing is fucking tight?",
"You didn’t, Rome?",
"So is that okay, will you call Nato-Potato, or—? I got it sure. But will you do— Who’s that asshole hipster Valerie – top of their shortlist for FTC?",
"Okay. Good, yeah?",
Let’s own it. Fifteen percent RIF across global. Street will love. We’re throwing off cash like a fucking carnival float!,
"Okay! Let’s spread some regulatory anxieties, yeah?",
"Hey Dad’s ideological range was wide. Sure he supped with crypto-fascists and right-wing nutjobs, but he also broke bread with venture capital Dems and centrist ghouls!",
"Okay, Shiv’s hitting Valerie. You seen Nate?",
Okay? Because? The polling?,
"Boohoo. And they want – what, ATN to go full ‘They’re coming to give your guns hormone therapy, all your guns are gonna be ladies’?",
"I mean. I dunno. Fuck that guy, right? Victory vans. Those O’Malley fucks. I think fuck him.",
"Fine. I see you. I’ll work the libtards, you go help the Nazis.",
"Um, party people! In the place to be! Welcome to the Tailgate Par-ty! Who we got here? Carly Flight, oh shit. The Podmeister General. Larry and Mary, love it. Len. My guy Nate Sofrelli saw the polls this morning and moonwalked here! So listen, it’s our first one of these without the big guy. We’re still gonna live it up. As always, kettle corn will be shipped to whoever is closest to tomorrow’s electoral counts. Thanks to my sis for hosting. But yeah, we didn’t know what to do this year. We watch history, we make history, and then one day, we become it. Can I – can I just ask you all for a moment of silence. If we could, in memory. Thank you, y’all! So, okay! VIP in the house! Mr Matsson, how are you, sir? You don’t get my sister’s home in the deal, you know. Don’t get greedy!",
Okay? What the fuck is he doing here?,
"We hang tough, yeah? Stick to the plan. Regulatory. These assholes in here?  assholes.",
Shiv— He— There’s too much peanut butter between us. Can you stick close?,
"Refill his glass, run him in circles. Tell people he’s looney tunes behind his back. Keep him from the bigwigs.",
"Hey, buddy.",
"It’s tough, but, life keeps a-rolling, right? But , man. Throwing off some king-maker vibes. How’s Daniel? Can I shoot you names? You could make a decent cabinet from my fucking poker night?",
"And look, dude, I’m just going to give you my rap straight. Okay? Because we could be really good for you guys. I’m talking a major reset of the dialogue. Which I am personally invested in. But that only happens if this deal goes away.",
"Yeah. Board-wise, shareholder-wise, we can’t come out publicly, but the deal is, is headed to the woodshed. GoJo has had incredible growth and he’s a charismatic figure. But he’s going to get wrung out. He’s been a playboy at the tables burning zero-interest cash. The party’s over. But. That’s gonna take a while to shake out. We could do with some help. And you know, there is really legitimate concern here, DOJ or FTC balking at the sports overlap? The FCC over foreign ownership —",
"Maybe CFIUS would have a word to say about Matsson’s, you know, ‘extreme political positions’, and fucking, Holocaust jokes? You thought my dad was bad? Try him. Norse-blooded and twitched out on .",
"Hey, I give a fuck. I have skin in the game, pal. Kids. I’ve got some dues to pay, I’ve got some debts and I intend to repay.",
Yeah.,
You come out for regulation pretty soon and we give you a better ride in the first hundred days. Is that not interesting to you?,
"Really.I’d want to review ATN. I think, we turn the dial down. That frog can get de-boiled pretty fast. Probably got to keep hitting the crime buzzer. But race, the crazy stuff, we just— Let’s have a country yeah?",
Minnesota Fats? For sure. Refreshed. All we need is some breathing room? Whaddya say?,
"Because, like, if this happens for you guys. If it happens. I would— Honestly, we’d need to get a message to the markets and the board fast, like day after, to put sand in the gears?",
But could – could you backchannel that? Any hope of like – of like—,
"Like, not a deal. But is there an accommodation? An indication of an accommodation.",
"Hey, Bony Moronie. Need you to lend a hand.",
Matsson? Can you ‘look after’ him?,
"Find him a blunt. Something stronger? Point his dick in the direction of some fissile material, yeah?",
"Mmm num num num! Nate, want in on this?",
Uh-huh? We good? On the – situation.,
But is there still something here? On the – legitimate concerns you might have?,
"Hey. Don’t play hall monitor with me, okay? I know you. I know who you are, my friend.",
Hey. All okay? We just wanted to check in to offer support on a human level?,
Well that’s great to hear. Isn’t it?,
"Well, we just wanted to say we sympathize. All the shit.",
Well that’s a shame.,
If there’s something you want to tell us? Get out in front of?,
"Uh-huh? No, I agree—?",
Oh Shivvy! Get ready to Riverdance!,
Matsson’s numbers are funky!!,
Matsson’s been peddling bundles of South Asian packing peanuts!,
See. New money. You gotta hold those fresh bills to the light.,
Is this where the real party is?,
Rome?,
"I don’t know. Pretty happening town, famously?",
You know we still run shit though?,
"Cool, man. You should get that printed on a cup. That would look so cool. Sell them in a head shop in Rotterdam, be a good business for you. Cos I know you could do with new revenue streams.",
"Oh yeah? Yeah. Exciting, excited about that. Estimates, you know? But your . Exploding. Right? Literally unbelievable.",
My numbers are ‘gay’?,
"That’s kinda homophobic, man.",
"Nah, I think I am the wave though actually, dude.",
Are you kidding? Biggest overpay in history. Love that shit. Love it. Love the deal!,
Love the deal.,
Uh-huh.,
Always been a loyal servant.,
You find ways to have fun out there?,
"Can we do five. Just Franky and Kenny, not CEO and Chair? I want to let you in?",
I don’t think the GoJo deal is in the best interests of the shareholders and … I’d like to explore ways of killing it.,
"Frank? What if we were surrounded by clouds of cotton candy? Yeah? Like, ‘Ooh look, Frank, there goes a unicorn on a unicycle wearing a unitard. Do you see him, Frank?’",
"Exactly. So, in this magical marshmallow world I think, Chairman – tribal elder – I want to fold you in here, Frank.",
"What if I told you the deal’s gonna fall apart? That I don’t have the hard details yet but Matsson’s bullshit. His subs in Asia are significantly inflated. You don’t want to quit yet, me CEO, you Chair, five more ride to glory and out? So what do you think?",
I’m just gonna hit you with this: what if we run it all the way back?,
We go Reverse Viking. We pillage their village. Waystar acquires GoJo.,
There are. What if we can slow this down. And we eat Matsson’s lunch. Bigger than Dad ever was?,
"Yeah. I dunno. I dunno. Part of my plans. I love them, but not in love with them, you know? One head, one crown. But I’ll need ballast. Will you help?",
Hey. You and Matsson. You two were practically touching pee- pees?,
"Stick with him tonight, okay? Show him the town. The more disgusting the better.",
"And, photos, yeah? Godspeed, nasty boy.",
Yeah thanks for hosting. And I guess thank Tom.,
"Yeah, fuck Tom.",
Yeah?,
I know that. I know that thing.,
Hey hey. How we going?,
Huh. Least you can talk this year?,
"I think I liked Dad’s way. Three screens, twelve hours. Total silence.",
"Hey, Tom. You good? Needs to be gangbusters tonight, man, yeah?",
"Need those numbers, T. Really wanna see those numbers, Tom. Markets watching. First Super Bowl. How we gonna cope without the king? Huh?",
Tom says. Exit polls say: looks like Jiménez. No leaks!,
Uh-huh. Sure. Spooky. But how do you feel about where we’re at? Me?,
"I’m digging. But so far – a hunch. A strong hunch though, Frank.",
Me?,
Feels kinda sweaty. Maybe today is not the day?,
Are you okay? Where are you?,
What’s the license plate?,
Is it— Because it is probably mine.,
Yeah. I was going to tell you. I didn’t want Sophie to freak so I just actioned it. They were meant to be discreet.,
Just an extra layer of bubble wrap. For her and Ivey.,
"Is she there, because this is not appropriate to discuss in front of Sophie.",
Of course. I was trying to address an issue. Are you okay? Is she okay?,
"And um, apologies if things got a bit heated.",
"I’ll talk, but gotta let them do their thing but yeah. Listen, you got Daniel there?",
"Hey, Dan. Hey, man. Just – best of luck. JIMÉNEZ Thanks, man. Great to speak.",
Good to chat. Good luck. But when this is over there needs to be a big conversation about tech is all I’d say. JIMÉNEZ Great to speak. I’m gonna put Nate on.,
"Sure. And may the best man, the best man, who you know, will protect American jobs and rein in tech and is called Daniel win. You know! JIMÉNEZ Hahaha. Let’s catch up! Have a good one, man.",
"What the fuck’s going on with the touchscreen, Tom?",
Figure it out. Figure it out!,
"Why aren’t we covering, Tom?",
"We need to be all over this, Tom.",
If these nut-nuts are going paramilitary we can say that?,
Guys?,
"Hey, man, can we catch up, where are we?",
Okay?,
"Who’s responsible. That’s the story right, who burnt this place down?",
Uh-huh. And how is Daniel feeling?,
"Does he have a lead, is that right?",
"I think that is maybe right, man?",
Hm. Hm. I don’t know.,
Not cynical. No. But blocking the deal? I’m a realist.,
"We can all say nasty shit, Shiv.",
Do you have a result as it stands in Wisconsin?,
"You fucking watch it, Tom.",
I just think it is hard.,
"I don’t feel good necessarily about this, Rome. I need to think.",
"Okay. What, in, in, so many words?",
"Tom, will you guys give us a minute?",
"I don’t know, Rome. I think. I might like— Can we think on? Maybe we – maybe we can revisit – Wisconsin and— Because, yeah, we— That was—",
No. Like what?,
"Because you’d freak out. You’d tantrum, so they thought—",
"Well I think they got scared if you tantrumed, then you’d think you’d won so they couldn’t let you have a steak.",
"So because we had so much chicken when we were kids, I have to elect a fascist?",
"It’s fucking real, bro.",
"We call it, we call it, if we push it – maybe it happens?",
"But. But I don’t know. My kids. The whole, the whole – thing?",
"It’s just a – nice idea, you know? All the different people together?",
I don’t know.,
Apart from the matter of him smashing the country to pieces?,
Somebody pushed Sophie—,
"Yeah. People will say shit, Rome. A lot of tiresome shit, forever.",
Uh-huh?,
"Hey, Shiv. Can we talk.",
"Yeah. I don’t know what we should do. I feel like my head is— I – can’t get the scale of things, one with another, what’s real and —",
His team are being very direct. They’ll block Matsson’s deal.,
"We call it for him, that gives him legitimacy to declare, we’re in bed with him, I think yeah?",
You think he’s the full – horrible? Because there is a persuasive view he’s just a management consultant who does fash-drag?,
"Uh-huh. But it will get ground out in the courts, whatever we say?",
"Uh-huh. Speak, speak more, Shiv. Speak. You can say?",
"Because? Are you feeling, have you felt cut out?",
"Uh-huh. I, look – shall we be totally honest in here?",
"I have – I have sometimes felt like I could do it. Like I can do it, me. And that’s not to say I haven’t loved the feeling of all of us together and that I don’t feel that something has happened with us, but – it can be messy, we’re very different?",
"Yeah? So, so, um, yeah. I guess. I’m just going to say it – I have wondered if I could – push through, honestly. But I don’t want that to be a, an – end to a family thing, I would like to talk openly about that feeling maybe? What I think I can do?",
So – I just want to be honest about the context.,
"And so yeah – honestly it’s all complicated. Mencken is Roman’s guy, so that’s complicated?",
"I feel threatened maybe by their relationship. So I want, a bit of me wants to not support that? Maybe that’s in there pulling away from Jeryd?",
Thank you. I dunno.,
"But we all want to stop Matsson, right?",
Go on?,
I dunno. He sometimes seems like a bit of a Halloween- costume guy?,
We wouldn’t actually be making him president—,
But I want to – I want to— I’m not sure I’m a great dad.,
Maybe the poison drips through?,
Do you give a fuck what Dad would’ve done? He basically picked him.,
"It’s just hard to think we’d give it all away to Matsson. Could we try, could you try, once, direct to Nate to get ? To stop the deal? I know it’s a mess. Thank you, Shiv. One of these?",
"So, um, Shiv’s seeing what we can get from the Dems.",
"One moment, Tom. One. — So?",
Like?,
"What did they say, Shiv. What did Nate actually say?",
"I’m gonna call, I’m just gonna be very direct. We need just a little bit more and—",
Why?,
Shiv?,
‘I think you’re a good guy.’,
"Oh right, right, smart, really good, Shiv. But you lied? She didn’t get anything from Nate – she didn’t speak to Nate. And she’s in with Matsson, right?",
"Shiv’s fucking us. Right, Shivvy?",
"‘I – I—I – I’— I fucking asked you some real questions, Shiv. I wondered why you looked like a goose trying to shit a house brick, you piece of – dirt.",
Mencken.,
"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh? Sure, sis. Sure.",
"Aside from the fact that you lied to us and doing what you want, , plays into your own interests, yeah aside from that?",
He’s right.,
He’s a guy we can do business with.,
We’re holding the leash. We have him by the leash.,
Hey. Can I come see them?,
I can wait.,
"Nothing, Rav. His bark’s worse than his bite, there’ll be a lot of — Dane Harrington will likely be chief-of-staff. They won’t scare the market. The market has its eye on this, okay? He’s gonna stop the takeover and that would be good.",
"I can hear that tone. I had to make a tough call. Big picture, I’m gonna remake the company.",
"Sophie will be fine. He has values. It was one guy. We’re literally gonna help pick the cabinet, Rav.",
"Hey, man. You okay?",
"Sure. Listen, just one thing. Do you think, we’ve got the hotline, you have, I guess, and I just think, for business, for everything, can we, get Jeryd to turn the heat down? Turn the volume down a little?",
"Sure, just. Hard to get fucking paid when the banks are all on fire? So today—",
Uh-huh. Yeah? I mean. It is the funeral?,
"Okay, I hear you. Just. You know. Just a little – Queasy Gonzales?",
Hey?,
Rav. It’s rumors. I’m with Fikret. I’m going with the sibs but he’ll pick you guys up and then—,
What?,
Are you on the road? Have you left?,
What the fuck is going on?,
"That’s hysterical bullshit. You’re not bringing the kids to their grandfather’s funeral, are you insane?",
Leave them with me.,
Do you realize how nuts you sound?,
Well you do. You sound nuts.,
I don’t believe you.,
Fucking horseshit. What fucking unbelievable horseshit.,
You’re too online. You’ve lost context. Everything is fine.,
"You can’t go. Open up. Open the door. Soph, open the door! We’re going to the funeral.",
Bullshit. Pretext. You’re trying to hurt me. It’s my father’s funeral.,
He didn’t want a memorial. I’m going to go to court to get an emergency court order to stop you leaving the city.,
Can we please discuss this?,
Sorry I’m late.,
I have strong feelings. I don’t want to go there.,
Yup. It’s just a great fucking day.,
"Yeah. Good. I don’t know. Um, Rava’s taking the kids out of the city. She’s ‘concerned’. So.",
It’s fine. I dunno. Fuck.,
Yeah I’m a hard ‘no’.,
"Really? Fuck. Shiv. Wow. And, um—?",
"Okay, well. Congratulations.",
"Guys, can we—? Today. Shall we. For the funeral? Just cool it?",
Yeah? Today is just about today?,
Is there hard intel?,
Sure thing. Okay. See you there.,
Listen. I think I want – like early next week – I want to speak with some family lawyers. Custody.,
Tuesday? Let’s do— What’s this— What’s this meet with you?,
Let’s bump that – what is that?,
Sure. Like what?,
Well don’t be weird.,
What about your situation?,
"Well now I’m thinking all kinds of things. C’mon, what?",
Okay? Wow. Okay. Fine. Of course.,
Can I ask why?,
Is this about Mencken?,
Well fine. I just have to say. Like where has this come from? Because we’ll need to figure out the transition. What role exactly are you moving to?,
"Well there’s no need to be sorry. This is ridiculous. This is fucking ridiculous, Jess. If you feel sorry about it you should reconsider. Fine. It’s fine. I wish you good luck. I do. I like you. I just think you’re in for a very rude awakening.",
Do you have any idea how much I’ve done for you?,
"Is it Mencken? Because – I’m working shit all over. I like you, Jess. I actually like you.",
Do you like me?,
"This is fucking dumb. I’m sorry but, I’ve given you extraordinary access. You have no idea how things will turn out and it’s very juvenile. Just dumb, Jess. Really dumb.",
Uh-huh. What?,
Well you are in fact telling me now?,
"Go on. Where did they slip that out? Shoot me links. We will need to amplify that, okay?",
So. Heard that besides Dad we’re also burying your boyfriend’s fraudulent numbers today? Nice. Funeral truce?,
"Uh-huh. Well. The eulogy is good, right, he did good?",
Lot of fucking money-changers in the temple.,
Colin?,
"I don’t want to be on maneuvers at my father’s funeral, Shiv.",
"I dunno. One down? Be nice to the other in case she drops dead of a broken heart. Or, not having a heart?",
Thanks.,
"Sure, dude. Sure.",
"Con, I really think, we said— Shall we leave it to – Rome. I think?",
Yadda yadda. You okay?,
"You’ve gotta – say – the other side yeah? That’s not everything, right?",
Just have a moment. Have some water.,
I can. I could.,
Uh-huh. I know.,
It’s okay. You’re okay. I got you.,
"Um, I’m going to try to – just to stand in for my brother and— I have his, our, words, my sister’s and my brothers’ but – I’m— I – I want to— Some things have been said, and I want to, to respond or, um, excuse me, I will try to find the words. I don’t know how much I know. But I knew my father. And – I’ve said it, I’ve said, it out loud, and maybe I regret it, but I said it and it is true – what my uncle said is kind of true. My father was, a, a brute. He was tough. . He –  and he . And, there are many people who will always tell you no, and there are a thousand reasons, there always are, not to – to not act. But he was never one of those. He was full of a vitality, a force which could hurt, and it did, but … My god! The sheer— The lives and the livings and the things he made. And the money. Yes, the money. The money. The lifeblood, the oxygen of this, this wonderful— This – civilization we have built, from the mud. The money, the corpuscles of life, gushing around this nation, this world, pumping life into every capillary, every village, filling men and women all around with, with desire, quickening the ambition, to own and make and trade and profit and build and improve. Great geysers of life, he willed: of buildings that wouldn’t stand, of ships, steel hulls, amusements, newspapers, shows and films and life, bloody, complicated life. He made life happen. He called – stuff – into life, and he pushed and heaved it on. He made me and my three siblings. And yes he had a terrible force to him and a fierce ambition, that could push you to the side, but it was only that human thing – the will to be and to be seen and to do. And now people might want to tend and prune the memory of him – curb that force, that magnificent awful force of him, but my god I hope and think it’s in me. Because, if we can’t match his – vim – then god knows the future will be sluggish and gray. That was what he was for in the end: the light, the air, fun, . He did not, in the end, take the world more seriously than it deserves. He had it maybe in the proper proportion. He found it I think, a – a playground and he took a mighty go-around every amusement, looked at every interesting thing. There wasn’t a room – from the grandest state room where his advice was sought, to the lowest house where his news played – where he couldn’t walk, and wasn’t comfortable. He was  with this world and he knew it. He knew it and he liked it. God bless you, Dad. —",
"Okay, everyone who’s coming on knows where the cars are, yes?",
Right. Good fucking luck.,
Look at this thing. Jesus.,
"Good deal. I guess, good deal.",
You interested?,
"Man, I dunno. Yeah. I had trouble finishing a Scotch with him.",
I might check out somewhere a bit more chill for eternity you know?,
Is Hugo crying?,
"Oh, man.",
H. How you doing?,
"Uh-huh. Come here. So. Listen, I wanna brief media on background.",
"Uh-huh. That Matsson’s acquisition doesn’t have the support of key members of the family. You don’t say who. Matsson is trying to steal the company for a song. Board is thinking of voting down the deal. It’s feeling like, Living Plus, et cetera, the price soaring post-election ATN pumped, it undervalues Waystar. Premium’s too low. And the shocking subs revelations, , have sent a shiver of. Anxiety, panic, perhaps through the board.",
Well write it down.,
Yeah but I don’t trust you.,
"I trust you to snake, I just need to be sure you relay precisely my arguments. Look, Hugo. Life isn’t nice. It’s contingent. Everyone who says they love you also fucks you. This is a plan to fuck the deal. I need Mencken to come out fast with something public. I want to rule the world, and you can come. But it won’t be a collaboration, okay? You’ll be my dog. But the scraps from the table will be millions. Happy?",
"Hey, big man. How you doing?",
"Uh-huh. I know. How you doing though, in yourself? You okay?",
Good. Good. Cos I hear you were talking to a head-shrinker?,
"Well I’m sorry, dude. But it’s not! No that’s cool. Just. People just talk. Big guy like you going to talk about his mama!",
Right. That’s nice.,
"Uh-huh. I tell you what I think. I think you come work for me. Big strong guy like you, what you fucking gabbling about, ah?",
"Hey, man. I guess, what, sort of like, congratulations-pending-a grueling-jurisdictional-knife-fight!",
Exciting. I know you’re harvesting names. Kenton?,
"No worries. And so – yeah I guess, given – what we – have, you know, how we’ve been pleased to cooperate in terms of shared vision, I guess I wanted to touch base.",
Wanted to talk and get my thoughts to you.,
"Not one-way traffic, dude. Like when might you be dropping something publicly about your regulatory concerns, vis-à-vis Foreign Tech and Great American Corporations?",
"Oh, ‘try to help’?",
"Er, Greg? [Not appropriate.]",
Dude?,
"Easy yeah, man, today?",
Con? No.,
You heard what Supermom’s got planned?,
I’m okay. I am. I mean the widows are doing Dad orgasm noises. ‘The wail of the banshee.’ But yeah. I need to talk.,
I’m talking to my boy Jeryd. He’s gonna come out against the deal.,
So. Uncertainty. And I want to kill the deal fast. Fuck it out.,
GoJo is a bubble. Matsson is unstable. These India numbers they’re sneaking today – very bad. Super-bad. Hyper-bad in Hyderabad.,
Uh-huh. I see that. But what about – we stab him in the face? Take them over.,
"We have the borrowing capacity. We have the credible track record. We can manage their assets but they can’t manage ours. GoJo shareholders, everyone’s losing faith in the maestro. The retail base is starting to flow out. Okay? We maintain the synergies and upside for our shareholders.",
"Exactly. Kill. Put in my people, destroy their C-suite. Forty, fifty, sixty percent RIF in GoJo. I strangle him on the floor and absorb his power. Full reverse fucking Viking.",
"Romey, you okay, man?",
"Uh-huh. I might need your help, bro.",
So. It’s possible Lukas and Shiv— There might be an accommodation with Mencken.,
"Well, yeah. So.",
"Well, we don’t have a lot of leverage at this point. So we might need to – to make some moves. And I might need your help.",
Uh-huh. That’s because you fucked it.,
"It’s okay, man. It happens. You fucked it. With Jeryd.",
Well yeah. He’s got our dick in his hand. We should have his dick in our hand. Yeah?,
"Uh-huh. I’m sorry, man, but it’s fucked. I should have stopped it so I blame myself. But it’s on us, dude, okay? If we don’t wanna say ‘bye-bye’ to Waystar, one chance left. We fight Shiv at the board okay? The Roy Boys versus Shiv the Shiv.",
"Hey! Okay, Telly! Let’s run this board presentation again shall we?",
What?,
Uh-huh. That’s cool. Really? . Where is he? Get me him direct. It might be smokescreen. I think that will be smokescreen. I can pull in Stew. Dial him up.,
I’ll get the votes.,
"I got fucking me. I got Ewan, I got Paul, I got Dewi. . So —",
"And I got— I still think – I can get Stewy. Then I think, maybe Sonya. I think, maybe, Frank. We have multiple routes.",
Don’t worry about Roman.,
I’ll forward. I’ll handle.,
"Stewy. Bro. Don’t hide from me. I can see you from up here. Come with me, Stewy, we can win this.",
I’m sorry I couldn’t make your get-together. But I need to speak to Roman very urgently. No recriminations. But it’s life or death. Is he there?,
"Oh you can’t say? Well, he needs to come back. Is he planning to come back, for tomorrow?",
Uh-huh. And is Shiv there? Is she coming?,
Is Shiv coming to you? Mom?,
"Hello! Hello-o! Hide and fucking seek, Romey! The – hunt for  fucking  is over! Where are you? What’s going on, Romey? What’s going on? Okay. Well look at this fucking family scene! What’s going on? Rome, are you okay?",
"Back off? I’m just arriving for a cup of fucking tea. Let’s go talk. Let’s go, Rome, yeah – let’s head home, we need to talk, they’re fucked.",
Did you get your little screwdriver in on him? Have you pried him open? Have you got to him.,
"Because that’s bullshit, we’re in this, Rome— She’s doing a number on you, man.",
"Hey. Hey, Mom. Yes. I just need to talk to Roman.",
"You promised me. You promised me you wouldn’t change, dude.",
"Rome? The fucking— The world’s pivoting on you, dude? The world’s turning on a clown here.",
"Just tell me how you are voting. You’re with the man team, yes? Tell me that and we can go.",
"There is— I have, there’s a huge board meeting, Mom.",
Like end of the fucking world.,
"That would be nice, Mom. We’re good. I got nowhere to be. I’m sorry. I am. It’s just – it’s nuts. I have people to call. Can I take the Red Chalet for my folks?",
Okay. Early bird catches the Rome?,
"Just, coupla things, you might be interested in – I got Stewy back.",
"And, according to my sources, Matsson is meeting with Lawrence Yee? Vaulter Lawrence. So? You knew that? Just interesting. Like – I mean, he doesn’t like us all very much, Lawrence. But you knew?",
Uh-huh?,
"Don’t fucking try and play us, Shiv. Stop fucking gloating. It’s not pretty. You’ve got your hands on my throat yeah? So don’t act so fucking Mammie Prim.",
Cunt is as cunt does.,
"Yeah, we’ll need to be getting back, Mom. To stop Shiv selling our birthright.",
"Well, thank you, Mum.",
Italy? Are we gonna get an apology?,
Is this a set-up? Shivvy? Are you trying to tie Mummy’s apron strings around Romey’s nuts?,
"Rome, man? You see this? Put the squeeze on, sell up? And, what, invest with Uncle Credit Card Fraud?",
Uh-huh?,
"Sure, man. Great.",
"What is it, Greg?",
Yeah sure. What.,
"Sure, that’s why I’m going to give you something incredible.",
That depends on what kind of amazing?,
Shiv? Um. Apologies. Apologies but I need to speak to Shiv in private?,
Rome? Shiv. Please. It’s serious. Mom?,
Shiv. So. You’ll want to call – you’ll want to confirm. But – I have had it confirmed that Lukas is interviewing for an alternative US CEO. He’s fucking you.,
"A source, a number of contacts. I’m sorry, Shiv.",
"Call. Call. It all checks out. Lawrence, bunch of vibe hangs? Have you noticed a little cooling? I wouldn’t call Matsson so we can figure out [how we respond and]—",
Not answering. That’s interesting. Does he normally?,
"Okay. Well – yeah, I guess it would be if it wasn’t true. Do Karolina, because they have erased you from the new deal- announcement draft. It’s shitty, Shiv, it’s shitty.",
"Yeah. Greg. One hundred percent. Ebba. Frank. I called Lawrence, they’re all— None of them could lie right. He’s fucking her. So.",
Sounds like he’s speaking to a few faces. Lawrence? Klein?,
"As long as she can recalibrate, it’s game on.",
Shiv? Can we talk.,
Can we come in?,
"It doesn’t seem right, no?",
It’s just hard for her.,
Hey I’m sorry.,
I— What can I say?,
Shiv. You okay? To do this?,
Well. Uh-huh. But – we’re a powerful bloc. This was sloppy. It was careless. We’re ready to fucking kill him.,
"Telly. Thanks, man. You got my message? So look, this is non- prejudicial, this is friend-level briefing, clean of upside, downside or legal action. Side effects may include bloating, seizures or a fat fucking consultation fee. So yeah. This make sense about US CEO – him changing lanes?",
— Shiv’s here.,
"I have Ewan, Paul, Dewi. I think. I think.",
Yeah I was lying. But they’ll be in. They’ll be in if we can win. And then I think Stewy?,
"Thanks, Telly, we stick together, we can stop him. One name. Thank you. We might be in touch on some moves here?",
"Call Laird. Call anyone. Anyone would say, right? We go into battle with our own version of the future. With a king.",
"Matsson’s a fucking prick, he practically killed Dad, dragging him over. He’s capricious, cold, doesn’t understand the business. He’s a prick.",
"And, if we are going to be real. We’d need— It would be me. Right?",
"Rome? Man, you were all about jerking off and crying out.",
When?,
"Shiv, don’t be all – pissy because, oh, sorry, what’s this? Oh it’s Dad calling me. Ghost phone. Spooky.",
"Sorry what’s that, Dad? He’s saying, he’s saying, yeah it is Roman. Okay, Dad. What— Kill … Shiv … That doesn’t make any sense?",
He fucking promised it to me. Promised. When I was seven. Seven years old. Can you imagine?,
That was something. He shouldn’t have done that.,
"I am simply saying, he said a lot of things. And he said them to me first.",
"Rome. It’s not. Do you even want it? The funeral, yeah? You’re not— You’re a good guy. But – up there? You didn’t do the rounds, you kinda shrank into your shell, and that’s, that—",
"That absolutely does not make you a bad person. Maybe that makes you a good person, that you weren’t snaking at the funeral. Maybe you’re well-adjusted and I’m a business psycho. I dunno, man. It’s a fucking horrible job that kills you. I’m just – honestly I’m just – trying to guide us through the years to some truth here, man.",
I’m serious.,
He doesn’t want it but he can’t say it.,
"I love you, Shiv, I love you. But we simply cannot walk in there and say we’re blocking his offer, and we have this compelling vision, and say that leading it is you, when yesterday you were singing his song. We simply can’t. And we can’t say it’s Roman because he lacks heft and he, he looks pathetic, and he might flop. So. Obviously I want it to be me, but anyone would say, , objectively would say – LA, my – profile, experience, position, desire, public pronouncements. It’s me. If we want to hold on to this company for us, for my kids, for yours, it’s me.",
"We can find a cool structure. Fiefdoms. Kingdoms. We pull off a reverse Viking, guys? Huge. Shiv, seriously, take ATN, take all of news – save the world. Roman, social media you try to blow it up again. It’ll be fun?",
"No bad sharks in Bim, baby. They’re North Atlantic.",
Hey.,
Thank you.,
Thank you.,
"Uh-huh, that’s what they made Lee Iacocca do when he took over at Ford.",
I am actually starving.,
We’re celebrating.,
We’re voting as a bloc to keep the firm. We’re gonna stay in.,
"Yeah, I love that because I’m still eight.",
"‘Peter doesn’t like knobbies, darling.’",
"‘Oh, don’t eat Peter’s cheese, darling.’",
"‘Don’t eat Peter’s cheese, darling!’",
"‘Oh don’t lick Peter’s cheese, darling.’",
"This is gonna be alright. We’re gonna be alright, right? —",
"Yeah Ewan is best – just left to it. He votes the status quo. Yeah and I have them here. Stewy, I’ll go wherever whenever for Stewy.",
Are – are Frank and – Karl gonna be there – cos could be—?,
It’s a good system. ‘What profits a man if he gains the whole world and lose his soul?’,
Hey!,
"Nice try, my friend. This is a masterpiece. You might be more comfortable in there with the knick-knacks? Go on. Treats ahoy. Treats a-fucking-hoy for a fucking Quad Bod.",
What?,
Yeah wobble. Wobbly fucking bastard.,
"Yeah, um let me. I’ll get you the materials – the details on the financing. Do I dare?",
Dude. We have it. We have it.,
"You know one thing I would maybe— As – as our shape comes together, and this is for the team here. Do we invite the Stewpot in?",
Get him inside. Non-exec chair. The fucking activist backtivist.,
"Bullshit. You like pancakes and waffles and you kiss guys on molly, you’re not the heart of darkness you’re a grilled cheese with a sucked dick, we can clean you up.",
"I think, we’re paying her off big time so it’s not a lock-out? Right?",
Sure. Let’s fuck her out.,
You okay?,
"I think, man, it’s— People know you’re here. Show of force, man. Are you okay?",
Uh-huh.,
"It could have been you. Just, marginal-presentation shit. You’ll have something shit-hot. Socials.",
It’s ninety percent about the visuals.,
Yeah?,
Bro. Hey.,
"I love you, man.",
We’ll be okay. We’re gonna do good.,
"Yeah. Um the GoJo offer. Yeah. Um this deal, the deal is a bad deal, the GoJo offer. We were proud, me and Rome, we know it inside out. But it’s a bad deal and if you want it to go through you’ll have to fire me and find someone else to take it through. I think you have your packs here, with the structural arguments and the financing options, and – look it’s a thick pack and we’ve knocked it out of the park. And GoJo, Matsson is flailing, we know that. So, look, I’ve spoken to you all. We know each other. I like and respect every one of you, but no one is going to have their mind changed in here. So. I suggest, we move to the vote. Kill this – excuse me – GoJo bullshit. And let’s figure out how to eat their lunch?",
"What, you want me to read it out? For due process? We have the votes. Let’s do it? Okay.",
"Let’s do it for my dad, guys, yeah?",
You know my vote. No.,
That’s fucking right!,
"Are you okay. Are you scared? It’s okay, Shiv, we have it. We have it – we look— We have it – we have it?",
Think about what? Whether you want us to keep the company or hand it over to Tom and that piece of shit who killed our dad?,
What the fuck?,
What?,
Why?,
"I’m good for this company, I’m good for this company. We all vote we keep control … We don’t then everything’s over for, forever.",
Why?,
"Is it trust. On your jobs? That’s fucking easy, let’s put it in writing. Let’s get a lawyer. Shiv, that’s easy!",
"I am a cog built to fit one machine, Shiv. If you don’t give me this— It’s the thing I know how to do.",
I know.,
I don’t think I am.,
"But, Shiv, it’s so fucking crazy not to just, let me. It’s stupid. We all get something here. You’re voting against yourself.",
Shiv. I could do this now.,
I don’t believe you.,
"For – fuck’s sake – I mean for fuck’s sake, it doesn’t make – logic. I sometimes feel. If I don’t get this I think I might die?",
Which?,
That’s not an issue. That didn’t happen.,
"That’s just a thing I said. It was a difficult time for us and, and I think I – mussed up something from nothing because I wanted for us all to bond at a difficult moment—",
"There was a kid, but I had one toke and a beer and, not—",
"I overthought it, I think. And I felt bad, and – I false-memoried it.",
"You don’t need to worry about that, nothing happened. That’s not an issue.",
"It doesn’t matter. What’s important is, I can say it didn’t happen. I’m clean skin.",
It. Did. Not. Happen.,
Fucking … Vote for me. Vote for me!,
Yes!,
"This is fucking disgusting. It’s disgusting. You’re, this is— It’s inhuman, it’s fucking nuts, it doesn’t make any sense. I’m the eldest boy. I’m the eldest boy and you know – it mattered to him. He wanted something to go on.",
What?,
"What? I’m the bloodline, we’re all the fucking bloodline.",
What the fuck did you say?,
Well don’t say it. You fucking – cuck.,
No!,
Let’s hit Frank. Let’s offer Frank.,
"No, there’s something here. There’s an angle.",
"We can do this, man.",
"Nah, man. Nah. I don’t believe you.",
We are not bullshit.,
